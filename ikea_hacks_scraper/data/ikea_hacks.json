{"title": "How She Created Mudroom-Style Entryway Storage With IKEA Cabinets", "content": "Shoes by the door, coats draped over chairs, backpacks piled wherever they land. Sound familiar? Keeping your entryway tidy can feel impossible without a proper place to stash it all. But before you start dreaming about knocking down walls for a mudroom, there’s a smarter solution. DIYer and home organizer Laura Glos has a clever IKEA hack that turns a few BESTÅ units into sleek entryway furniture packed with hidden storage. It’s simple, affordable, and totally customizable. With a weekend’s worth of assembling IKEA cabinets, you can transform your entryway from chaotic to clutter-free. Put together the and all the other IKEA pieces according to the instructions. IKEA pieces are truly the meat and potatoes of this hack, with little extra supplies or materials needed. Therefore, you’ll spend the bulk of your time assembling all the different components. Build your wardrobe cabinet by positioning and stacking the BESTÅ to fit your needs. Laura has the larger TV unit on the bottom and the shorter one mounted to the wall. The drawers are in the bottom unit. The shelf with doors goes between the two TV units on one end. Attach all of the pieces to the wall using the appropriate hardware and to each other to ensure maximum stability. After securing all of the cabinets, add the two BESTÅ panels using heavy-duty adhesive, one on the top and one on the bottom. Some comments questioned whether the top panel would fall off, but Laura said it’s holding strong. (Plus, the clothes rod screwed into it is likely to add some extra reinforcement.) Use adhesive to install the acoustic panels on the rear wall and exposed side of the shelf unit. Laura got hers from Woodupp Germany . This adds a modern, sleek touch that enhances the custom feel of the overall design. The final step is adding the clothes rod, handles, and hooks as desired. If your wardrobe isn’t near a wall like Laura’s, look for a clothes rod with top mounts so you can install both ends into the top panel and cabinet. For a final touch, add lighting and other details to make the piece your own. About $1,065 Since this hack is essentially a series of BESTÅ storage units put together, you can really create any look you want. IKEA has so many different variations of BESTÅ cabinets, shelves, door styles, panels, and more. Depending on how much space you have, your unit could be smaller, larger, have more drawers, fewer drawers, extra shelves, and so on.

{"title": "This IKEA Hack Makes Organizing Laundry Incredibly Efficient", "content": "Doing laundry may never top anyone’s list of favorite chores, but one IKEA hack is proving that the right setup can make wash day more bearable. For many of us, the laundry room isn’t just for clothes. It’s also ground zero for everything from small repairs to household storage. That’s why creating a space that works hard and stays organized is such a sanity-saver. Home organizer Laura Glos ( ) shares her laundry room ideas, turning an ordinary utility room into a stylish, clutter-free haven. Her secret? A mix of IKEA TROFAST storage system and KNOXHULT kitchen cabinets, cleverly reimagined for laundry duty. “I use sorting baskets with clear labels — whites, darks, towels, you name it,” Glos says. “Everyone in the house puts their laundry straight into the right basket. It saves time, spares my nerves, and keeps the laundry room tidy.” Glos’s vision for the space was simple: create a functional, efficient, and beautiful utility room that worked as hard as it looked. By stacking three IKEA TROFAST units and combining them with sleek KNOXHULT wall cabinets and drawers, she designed a laundry station that’s practical and chic. She made a notch in the countertop to fit it around the edge of the TROFAST. The , typically found in kids’ playrooms, became the ultimate laundry sorting system — one for whites, another for darks, and others for delicates or bulky towels. With neatly printed labels and consistent color tones, the setup gives off a minimalist yet cozy aesthetic that feels more “boutique laundrette” than basement corner. Make your labels for your bins, designing them to match how you sort laundry. You can order , print them on your computer, or use a . For example, you may have a bin for whites, one for darks, one for delicates, and so on. If you don’t need nine bins for sorting, use the extras for storage. Or, depending on how many people are in the household, you might need a couple of bins to handle certain categories, like bulky towels. To finish, Glos installed , styling them with framed laundry guides and small décor items to soften the space. A bead of caulk sealed the counters for a crisp, custom look. The big bonus when it comes to DIY IKEA projects is that you get plenty of opportunities to create custom looks for less. Plus, since many of IKEA’s pieces offer various configurations and sizes, you get to maximize your space. For example, in Laura’s utility room, the pieces she uses from IKEA come to about $771. The breakdown is $246 for the TROFAST units and bins, $20 for the , and $505 for the KNOXHULT cabinets and drawers. However, there are a bunch of different sizes and shapes for all of these pieces. Therefore, you can create the perfect layout no matter if you’re dealing with a tiny utility closet or a large laundry room.

{"title": "I’m a Teacher and These Are the Top 10 IKEA STEM Toys I Recommend", "content": "After teaching preschool for over 15 years and becoming a mom, I can confidently say I’ve seen a lot of toys. Many parents prefer to get their kids toys with some educational component, and I’m one of them. But let’s face it. Toys are getting expensive these days. My son was looking through an Amazon Wish Book, and some of the simpler items that caught his eye were still $50 or more! I mean, don’t get me wrong, I adore my son, but I also like to keep the lights on and the pantry stocked. If you’re working with a tighter toy budget, , many under $15. Many of the items check all the boxes when it comes to providing children with a toy that fosters creativity, learning, and overall development. The popular child psychologist said, “Play is the work of children.” Therefore, to learn, grow and develop, children need to play, and their toys should support these needs. STEM toys reinforce the concept that children learn through play, focusing on the areas of science, technology, engineering and math. But not all STEM toys are created equal, and just because a plaything claims to be STEM, it doesn’t mean it is. In a nutshell, an effective STEM toy actively engages children in hands-on learning that encourages them to problem-solve, get creative, and think critically. They should also foster active learning, requiring children to interact and manipulate pieces and parts. You can find different levels of STEM toys to fit children of various ages. For example, simple toys like stackable cups or basic puzzles are great for babies, helping develop hand-eye coordination and spatial awareness. Older kids might find more advanced options featuring robotics and other high-tech elements appealing. are -authenticated and promote creative play that helps children develop foundational skills in the areas of science, math, engineering, tech, and beyond. Kids love them because they’re colorful and fun. Parents love them because of their educational value and affordable prices. Here are ten stand-out picks from IKEA’s STEM Toy Series. The puts a precious spin on a familiar classic. Children learn about shapes, colors, and size order while developing fine motor skills. Determining which order the rings go in helps children improve and practice logical thinking in a fun way. Placing the rings over the stick also helps develop hand-eye coordination. Kids love trains. It’s simply a match-up that makes sense and has persevered across numerous decades. But playing with trains isn’t just fun; it also provides oodles of learning opportunities. The 45-piece helps kids problem-solve and even explore physics and gravity as the train races over the hill. The different blocks for building the town also help reinforce concepts of balance and spatial awareness. Role-playing games are excellent for encouraging creativity, developing social skills and fostering communication. However, they go way beyond expanding the imagination. With IKEA’s , children learn about real-world experiences and reduce fears about going to the doctor’s office. The 7-piece set also helps kids build fine motor skills and work on their hand-eye coordination. The offers all sorts of play opportunities. It supports role-playing games like running a supermarket or being the cashier at a fancy boutique. The working register adds and totals transactions, providing kids with opportunities to sharpen their math skills. Play money helps with counting and number order, fine-motor skills, and sorting. The is a colorful, engaging way for babies and toddlers to develop hand-eye coordination and fine-motor skills. Children pound down pegs with the toy hammer, then flip the whole thing over and do it again. As they learn their colors, you can work with them on hammering a certain hue, doing the colors in order, or creating patterns. Building blocks are one of the most classic and timeless toys you can find. There are so many things kids learn when they’re working with blocks, including problem-solving skills, critical thinking, spatial awareness, balance, and fine-motor skills. The deliver these same educational opportunities, plus give children a chance to learn colors and shapes. The different blocks also provide an opportunity to work on sorting skills. Cars, trucks, basically, anything on wheels, are always super enticing for kids of all ages. The holds this same appeal, but also offers a ton of educational value. This toy is literally loaded with learning opportunities. Children can move the magnetic blocks with the crane, practicing dexterity and coordination. They can also simply build with the blocks, working on fine-motor skills. Sorting blocks by color and shape and fitting matching shapes into the truck bed teaches spatial awareness. Plus, the long pull string encourages children to tow the crane along as they walk and run, encouraging physical play and building gross-motor skills. The takes a familiar favorite and gives it a sweet story with a birdhouse theme. Children imagine that the different shapes are snacks for the birds living in the house, feeding them through the matching cut-outs. They can also stack and build with the shapes, which teaches about balance. Shape sorters teach shape recognition, spatial awareness, and build fine-motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and dexterity. They also help kids develop critical thinking and problem-solving abilities, and since the shapes are different colors, they reinforce color recognition, too. The is an excellent tool for teaching children about adding, subtracting, creating patterns, and counting. It also reinforces colors and encourages dexterity and coordination as children slide the beads back and forth in the rows. This is a great toy to bring on the go, too, thanks to its convenient folding design. Nesting cups are another classic toy that kids have enjoyed playing with for ages. The offer children the chance to practice their colors, learn size order, stack, build, and more. Kids also love water play, so they’ll enjoy filling and pouring water out of the cups (over and over again). As they play, children learn to think logically, problem-solve, use hand-eye coordination, and develop fine-motor skills. Plus, with the addition of water, they also learn about various concepts like capacity, volume, full vs. empty, and float vs. sink. Do you think your child would love some of the items on this list? Which ones do you think would be their favorites? The series offers a decent range of toys that cover a diverse range of ages and interests. But you don’t need to buy a toy to encourage fulfilling playtimes. There are also a bunch of creative hacks that turn IKEA favorites into interactive play experiences.

{"title": "This $50 IKEA Find Transforms Cabinet Into An Appliance Garage", "content": "You’re that person who actually uses your air fryer, espresso machine, stand mixer on the regular (because life’s too short for mediocre meals and instant coffee). But every morning, you’re playing Tetris with your toaster and coffee maker just to find counter space for your cutting board. Sound familiar? The design world recommends the “75% clear countertops,” and sure, it’s solid advice for the effortlessly chic kitchen vibe we’re all chasing. However, in real life, you really do need more than one or two small appliances out in the open. At least, I do. Here’s where the appliance garage comes into play. It’s a great way to keep things out of sight but still accessible. One hacker, Gülcan Öztürk , discovered that the IKEA UTRUSTA pull-out shelf fits perfectly inside their microwave cabinet, creating a quick and easy appliance hideaway. Follow IKEA’s instructions to install the pull-out shelf. The hacker did not have an IKEA kitchen; the shelf just happened to fit well in their cabinets. For reference, their cabinet is 60 cm wide, 60 cm deep. Make sure to measure your cabinet to make sure the UTRUSTA fits (24” x 24” including the frame). If your cabinet is slightly wider than the UTRUSTA shelf, you could install wood spacers. Use L-brackets, sunken screws, or nails to attach the spacers to each side of the cabinet’s interior. Then install the UTRUSTA. Gülcan uses a power strip inside the cabinet to plug in the appliances. There was already an outlet since the cabinet was intended for the microwave. Otherwise, you may need to hire an electrician to install an outlet; if so, ensure it is properly fitted to meet . $50 for the UTRUSTA shelf Several comments express concern about the shelf holding up to the weight of the appliances. Gülcan responded with a follow-up after ten months of using the shelf, saying that they hadn’t experienced any issues. IKEA specifies a maximum load of 635 ounces, or just under 40 pounds. Therefore, just keep that in mind, also accounting for the added weight when a kettle is full of water, etc. The other main concern mentioned was the combination of electricity and water. Plus, questions about the steam and heat generated by the appliances warping the cabinets or leading to more hazardous problems. Again, after 10 months of use, the hackers hadn’t had any issues, but I can definitely see the concern. Of course, they pull the shelf out when they use the appliances, but the height of the cabinet is pretty low. Perhaps allowing things to cool down before stowing them away would help. If you’re concerned about things like steam and heat, you could still use this idea for storage, essentially parking gadgets in an appliance garage. Then, simply place the appliances on the counter when you use them, and tuck them away again after they cool off. One thing about this hack that had people puzzled is that it isn’t necessarily a hack. After all, it’s a pull-out shelf that’s being used as a pull-out shelf. However, IKEA shows it off as more of an extendable work surface, for example, a pull-out cutting board inside a drawer. Therefore, seeing it here as a slide-out for appliances certainly gives people another idea of how to use the item. If you’re looking for a solution to clear clutter off your countertops, then this could be just the brainstorm you need. , and follow Gülcan Öztürk for more interior inspiration and design DIYs.

{"title": "How A Genius IKEA Wardrobe Hack Made a Walk-In Closet Possible", "content": "I dream about a walk-in closet. I really do. There’s something luxe about it, as long as you can organize it well. Alas, I have no space for a walk-in in my current home. Therefore, I envy this particular hack from Wendy @ ,  especially when she says, “With the new IKEA Pax system, this DIY is a breeze!” I did something similar in my first house using a curtain and clothes rods, but I had a larger primary bedroom in that home. Believe me, if my room had a few extra feet to spare, I would do this hack in a heartbeat. Yes, I would take a beautifully organized, efficient, to-die-for walk-in closet over a bit of extra floor space any day. If you feel the same way, and you have some space to spare, then this just might be the you’ve been dreaming about, too. Put together the you plan to use according to IKEA’s instructions. The size and number of frames you get really depend on how long you want your closet to be and how much space you have. Position the PAX perpendicular to the wall. Wendy cautions to leave at least three feet of space between the wall and PAX. This way, you have room to move comfortably inside your hacked walk-in closet. (If you have a lot of space to spare, you could even put some PAX along the wall if you’re feeling ambitious.) Wendy used timber to create framing for the side and back of the PAX wardrobes. This is all about adding more structure and reinforcement since the PAX are basically filled with cardboard (something a few commenters brought up as a concern). Wendy attached the framing on the side through the screws where the shelf supports would normally go. She says, “The wood is reinforced here, so you don’t screw into the cardboard part.” Also, the frames should extend up to the ceiling, where you can attach them with appropriate hardware to create more stability. You won’t be able to screw directly into the back of the PAX. Therefore, extend the side framing slightly so you can secure the back framing into it. Once the frames are in place, cut MDF sheets to size and add them to the side and back frames. Use wood filler and caulk to fill the screw holes and seams so you can get a nice, smooth finish. Add molding around the base of the side and back and between the ceiling and the top of the PAX to create a built-in look. Prime all of the MDF and molding, and paint as desired. How you deck out your PAX is up to you and what you plan to keep in your closet. is a handy way to choose the appropriate accessories, like drawers, slide-out shoe racks, hanging rods, and other organizers. One commenter asked why Wendy bothered with adding a frame and didn’t just screw the MDF directly into the PAX. Wendy addressed this in earlier comments, but it all comes down to stability. The PAX doesn’t offer enough support if you screw straight into it, so don’t skip the frame step. You’ll end up with the MDF coming loose and looking sloppy. Even worse, you could end up with it falling and injuring you or someone else. DIYs are great, but only if you take the time to do them safely. So, no shortcuts with the framing if you plan to make the back of the PAX look like a wall. What to do if you still want the same walk-in closet effect, but you don’t trust your carpentry skills with the framing and MDF?

{"title": "This Hidden TV IKEA Hack Keeps Your Bedroom Looking Calm and Clutter-Free", "content": "Apparently, you’re supposed to keep TV out of the bedroom because the bedroom is just for sleeping and, well, you know. But let’s get real. Plenty of us like to binge our favorite shows until our eyelids give up the fight. If having a TV in your room is non-negotiable, then we’ve got the hack for you! This clever hidden TV hack means you can maintain a peaceful, dare we say, even romantic, mood in the bedroom without sacrificing your late-night Netflix marathons. shows off an easy way to inside an IKEA . They originally had a 55” screen mounted on the wall, but they needed to get a larger wardrobe. This hack gave them a way to have both and hide the TV, too! Put together your PAX wardrobe according to your needs and IKEA instructions. For the purposes of this hack, make sure the frame size you choose is wide enough to accommodate your flat screen TV. The hacker’s screen is 42 inches. Use a slide-out KOPLEMENT shelf as the stand for your TV. Install timber braces to the shelf so you have a place to attach the drawer slides. Attach a square of wood to the slides, then install the folding TV mount on the wood. Attach the TV according to the instructions that come with the mount. Then slide out and fold up the TV whenever it’s time to watch your favorite show. The OP says that there’s even enough vertical clearance when the TV is in its folded position to keep a console or two (but that could push things over the max load — more on this below). The top concerns in the comments were about how safe it is to store the TV flat. Many people thought this wasn’t good for the TV, and others worried about hangers falling on the screen and breaking it. Another worry was how much weight the shelf could hold. Well, so far, Spense01 hasn’t had any problems. The shelf is rated to hold about 22 pounds, so just pay attention to the weight of the TV you choose (and don’t forget about the weight of the mount). Because you might be reaching max capacity once the TV is mounted, adding consoles may not be possible. As for things falling on the screen, after posting the hack, Spense01 added a shelf above it so that the TV is sandwiched when it’s stored away. The shelf acts as a protective barrier, keeping the screen safe from falling items and the OP’s curious cat. Finally, regarding storing the TV flat being bad for it, most users said that was the case with old plasma TVs. Others said it’s also more for when transporting TVs during shipping — that’s when storing them flat is a no-no. So, these are all things to be aware of, since there seems to be a bit of a debate. Spense01’s response to whether storing the TV flat was a good idea was simply, “I guess we’ll find out.” What do you think of this hidden TV hack?

{"title": "Need A Slim Shoe Cabinet? This Hack Is a Perfect Fit!", "content": "People say their biggest obstacle to creating effective shoe storage is space. It’s easier to just kick off their shoes when they get home, leaving them in a big pile by the door. Well, it’s time to bid those days farewell, thanks to this from The Flipped Piece . These tilt-out IKEA cabinets feature a slim silhouette that makes them perfect for stashing shoes in a narrow hallway or entryway. But you can use them anywhere (and for more than just shoes — we’ll put some ideas below)! Put together the three according to IKEA’s instructions. Decide where you want them to go and put them into position next to each other. Of course, if you have the wall space, you could even add a cabinet or two for more storage! Cut a notch out of the bottom back of each cabinet to clear your baseboard molding. This step helps give the finished cabinet a more built-in look. Use heavy-duty adhesive and clamps to connect the cabinets, then screw them into the wall using the appropriate hardware. To complete the built-in look, cut pieces of MDF to fit around the bottom of the entire piece. Scribe the edges to fit seamlessly over the shape of your molding. Then, use more MDF strips, cut to size, to cover the front seams where the cabinets meet. Caulk all the gaps to give the piece a nice, polished look. Scuff sand the MDF strips and cabinets and prime everything. After the primer dries, paint your cabinet any color you choose. Cut the scaffolding board to size to create a top piece for your cabinet. This makes the three cabinets look like one single piece of furniture. Sand it down and attach it to the top of the shoe cabinets with the adhesive. Apply a stain, varnish, or wax, depending on your preference. Install the handles and knobs, one on each cabinet. The hacker added gilding wax to give the piece a more aged look. However, you can skip the wax, depending on the look you’re going for. Add a few decor pieces to finish off the overall look. A mirror hanging on the wall above, a few statement pieces on the top, maybe a tray to gather essentials like keys, sunglasses, etc. The hacker fills these cabinets with shoes, which is excellent! But if you don’t have that many shoes or don’t need that much storage for shoes in your hallway, no problem. There are always ways to tweak storage to fit your needs.

Celine decided to give her METOD cabinets a makeover, creating a streamlined showpiece that gets everybody talking. When it comes to IKEA projects, are plentiful. But at the same time, they each have a unique look, utilize different IKEA collections, etc. It’s always fun to see how creators reimagine pieces into something similar, but do so in a variety of ways. Assemble all of your METOD components according to IKEA instructions, except for the drawer fronts. If you’re in the US, the equivalent IKEA line is the . You can adjust your pieces to achieve the desired size for your space. Plus, you can tweak it to fit your needs, for example, if you want to add more storage or only make the bench seat if you’re filling a smaller area. Celine had all her plywood cuts made at the DIY shop where she purchased the wood. You could do the same, or make the cuts yourself. The METOD cabinets are 37 cm deep. Celine made her plywood sides 58 cm deep. She also cut pieces to fit between the METOD cabinets. She placed her cabinets away from the wall, creating a space of about 8 inches. The plywood sides extend slightly beyond the front of the cabinets (so when the doors or drawer fronts are on, they would be flush) and reach to the wall. Place a cut plywood piece between each METOD frame, and use adhesive and clamps to hold in place. Screw everything together. Attach the 58cm side panel as well. Measure the length of your bench seat, including all of the panels and sides. Do the same for the top of the door units. Cut your plywood to size, making the top pieces 58 cm deep. The top should reach beyond the front of the cabinet bases the same amount that the side panels do. Cut a piece of plywood for your base that is the total length of your METOD pieces and panels and is 58 cm deep. Use furniture legs or make your own out of plywood. Celine made her legs high enough so that the base of her unit would rest right above her baseboards. Screw the base into the legs. Get the base into position against the wall. Enlist some extra hands to place the bench unit and cabinets on top of the base, then secure with screws. Add your top pieces. Celine used IKEA doors and drawer fronts as templates for her plywood components. Measure and cut four doors and six drawer fronts. Use a rotary-style bit to make the holes for installing the IKEA hinges. You can use the same bit or whatever size you desire to create the holes in the drawer fronts and doors. Alternatively, you could add pulls or knobs, or keep the fronts flat and try out the . Add plywood trim pieces across the bottom of the unit to hide the legs and give everything a more built-in look. Next, sand everything down and make sure it’s free of dust. Finally, apply the clear varnish and let it dry. Cut foam padding in your desired thickness to fit the bench seat. For the finishing touch, cover with fabric of your choice. Since there’s a gap between the METOD units and the wall, you won’t have full support underneath your bench pad. Therefore, you could add a plywood brace between the bench unit and the wall if you think you need extra support. This may or may not be necessary, depending on how you plan to use the bench. However, I’m the type that figures, the sturdier, the better.

{"title": "This TV Wall Hack Doesn’t Just Frame the Screen, It Steals the Show!", "content": "When you walk into a living room, the last thing you want is a lonely TV swallowed by a big blank wall. That’s where this jaw-dropping IKEA hack comes in. With sweeping arches, sleek wood slats, and cleverly budgeted IKEA BESTÅ units, this DIY transforms the TV wall into a statement piece that feels high-end, custom, and impossibly stylish. The talent behind this DIY, (Reddit), drew inspiration from a similar project on . The overall project cost about $1,500. Using helped keep the budget in check instead of having to build custom cabinets. Then, a great deal of talent, skill, and artistry helped bring the rest of this feature wall to life. Measure and mark with painter’s tape where you need to bring color down on the wall. You want to make sure it reaches behind the cabinets once they’re mounted. Cover the television and flooring with plastic or drop cloths. Prime and paint the wall the same color you plan to use for your shelves and slats. Put together the according to IKEA instructions. The hacker had to trim down the end unit to fit the cabinets wall-to-wall. You may or may not need to do this, depending on how much space you need to fill. Create cutouts where necessary in the back of the cabinets to run wires, cables, etc. Add timber strips onto the wall to act as supports for the cabinets. Mount the cabinets and screw them into the strips, making sure to use the appropriate hardware for your wall. Take your time and use a level to make sure everything is straight and flush. Build out the arches according to your necessary dimensions. The creator made tilted tops because they didn’t want to remove their crown molding. Make the units the same size and paint them and the shelves the same color as the wall. Measure and cut slats to size to fit from the ceiling to the top of cabinets, and adjust as needed to fit the pieces above and below the TV. Paint the slats to match the wall. Measure and cut the pieces for your countertop. Plane down if you need to adjust the thickness. Cut pieces to trim out the front of the shelves in the arches. Apply wood oil to the shelf trim and countertop. Mount the shelves to the wall, keeping the spacing even. Add the slats, carefully measuring to keep them equidistant. Finally, attach the countertop, screwing in from the bottom. This overview provides a glimpse at the basic steps for this project. However, understandably, this DIY has a lot more going on than a few simple steps. Therefore, make sure to and reach out to with specific questions. Expect to take some time to plan and measure before you dive into this one. It’s also important to determine if you want to fill an entire wall, add more arches, change the color, etc. I get it, you get so excited about a project that you just want to jump in and start sawing, painting, and building. But proper prep is key to avoiding mistakes and not wasting time or money. The hacker routed out grooves under the cabinets and arched shelves to add LED strips later. Therefore, keep this in mind if you plan to add some lights to your version. Also, be cognizant of where you would connect or plug the strips in so you can create the proper cutouts.

{"title": "Need Supersized Storage? This KALLAX Hack Is Huge! (Literally!)", "content": "Whoever coined the phrase “less is more” surely wasn’t talking about storage. I mean, the more ways to organize your stuff, the better, because it helps you maintain a tidy, stress-free home. However, it’s also understandable that you want to preserve your paycheck as much as possible. That’s why storage hacks get so much buzz, and IKEA pieces are at the heart of many of these DIYs. Some popular items turn up more often than others. For example, you’ll find plenty of out there because this IKEA powerhouse is extremely versatile. You can turn it into a , , or pretty much anything else you can think of. In this case, hacker Kayleigh Sherbourne uses two to create one massive, storage-packed wardrobe system. Put together the KALLAX units according to IKEA’s instructions. Kayleigh opted to leave some interior shelves out of one of the bottom units because she planned to use it for hanging space. Attach the KALLAX cabinets with screws. Position two side-by-side vertically on the bottom, topped with one unit horizontally on top. Paint the wall area that will be behind your wardrobe the same color you plan to paint the KALLAX. Then, create framing for the top and bottom of the wardrobe using timber and secure it in place with screws. Use the three brackets to attach the unit to the wall. Make sure to use appropriate hardware and anchors so that the wardrobe is sturdy and secure, with no danger of tipping. Add MDF strips to the top and bottom of the KALLAX, wrapping it around the sides. Also, add a strip across the place where the bottom and top units meet. This trim work gives the entire piece a built-in look that makes it appear even more custom and polished. Sand the unit, clean it to get it free of dust, and prime and paint. You’ll add a finishing coat later. Use the 9mm and 12mm MDF to create a barn door for the wardrobe. Paint the door, then apply a finishing coat to everything. Use hardware of your choice to hang the barn door (make sure the paint’s dry first), and install complementary handles. You can find fittings at your local home improvement shop or order online. Add any accessories you want to make your wardrobe work for you. Kayleigh used baskets, clothes rods, and drawers. Make sure to measure well so you can get fittings that suit the dimensions of your finished KALLAX closet. One of the biggest positives of this massive unit is that you get tons of storage and something custom for an affordable price. If you were to buy a wardrobe this size (approximately 60 inches wide by 88 inches tall) with all the different elements, you’d likely pay at least $600 or more. It’s especially impressive because of the height. Thanks to Kayleigh’s skill and the fact that the KALLAX is only $79.99 and $149.99, she could pull this off for about $300. She certainly makes it look easy, that’s for sure. Kayleigh was so happy with how her KALLAX wardrobe turned out that she even offered to make one for someone for free! Talk about loving what you do!

Athena uses the , an IKEA classic, to make a beehive-inspired lamp that’s super cute and stylish. Even better? It takes less than a minute. Really. The KÄLLARHALS vase is one of many that’s coming around the bend again with a snazzy new name. When the vibrant vase first came on the scene in 1995, it was known as the SNURRA. But no matter what you call it, the eye-catching style remains the same, and it’s just as fetching as a lamp. Plug in the lamp base and install the bulb. Athena used other IKEA products, including the (not available from IKEA US), but any similar piece will work. For reference, the measurements of the base are approximately 4 inches tall, with a base diameter of about 5 ½”. The main thing to pay attention to is that the height allows enough clearance so the vase doesn’t rest directly on the bulb. Flip the vase upside-down and put it over the base. That’s it! Several commenters pointed out concerns about the upside-down vase on top of the bulb. They worried it didn’t leave a lot of room for heat to escape. But since LEDs don’t get hot, and Athena kept the wattage low anyway, she didn’t have any issues. Therefore, if you opt to use a different bulb, make sure it’s an LED if you want to avoid any unwanted sizzle.

{"title": "This Vase Hack Sure Is One Berry Good Idea!", "content": "Ready to whet your DIY appetite with a simple yet stylish hack? Here’s one that looks good enough to eat, especially if you’re a fan of strawberries. It’s also easy to do with a little patience, paint, and glue. Magdalena Wöckinger is the brains behind this DIY, sharing, “I’ve seen vases like this in so many stores over the past few weeks and instantly fell in love with the design. The price, though … not so much.” Can’t say I blame her. The price for the vases she was obsessing over was about $175 — yikes! She decided to do her own thing and came out a winner with a cute strawberry vase dupe for around $23. Now that’s a much nicer number for the budget. Here’s how you can do the same! Use a spray paint suitable for glass to paint the red. Choose a paint that also works with plaster so you don’t have to buy multiple cans. Let the carafe dry while you move on to the next steps. Mix the in a bowl using water according to the plaster’s instructions, then pour into clean strawberry silicone molds. Magdalena said pouring the plaster was very calming, so hey, you might get a little stress relief out of this, too. Let the plaster dry, then remove the strawberries from the molds. Paint the plaster fruit with the same paint you used on the carafe and let them dry. Don’t bother painting the flat part that you’ll be gluing to the vase. That way, you can easily line the berries up on a piece of parchment and coat them with paint. Start adding strawberries to the carafe using a strong glue. Go around the top first and work your way toward the bottom. Keep the large end of the berries up, pointed sides down, except for the final, bottom row, if you want the same look as Magdalena’s vase. The bottom row of strawberries should be pointy-side up. Once the glue dries, finish everything off with another coat of paint for a seamless finish. When I was looking online at various , I noticed some were smaller, larger, shorter, or wider. Some had strawberries going sideways or alternating directions. One of them was even green pears (not as cute as the strawberries in my opinion). Basically, you could tweak this hack to a size and shape that suits your style and space. It’s one of the great things about DIY: you get to make it exactly how you want it. And there are all sorts of fun and glassware projects to try.

{"title": "This Clever PAX Wardrobe Hack Solves a Classic Small Bedroom Dilemma", "content": "When you’re tight on bedroom space, squeezing in extra storage often means sacrificing something else, like your bedside table. But what if you didn’t have to choose? That’s what Mathilda ( ) figured out. Instead of letting the two PAX wardrobes swallow up the space beside the bed, she carved out clever recessed niches right next to her bed. The small built-in wardrobe niches are perfect for charging her phone, a table lamp, and stashing nighttime essentials. It’s a brilliantly simple idea that looks custom, solves a real design dilemma, and needs no fancy tools or weeks of hacking. Let’s take a look at how Mathilda did it. Put together the PAX wardrobes and EKET cubes according to IKEA instructions. This step assumes you don’t already have PAX in place on either side of your bed. Position the PAX where you need them, and check out this hack if you want ideas for a . Cut a hole in the back of each EKET cube to create a pass-through for cables and plugs. Use the to hide the hollow insides of the cabinet and give the piece a more finished look. Make sure you use a rotary bit with the appropriate diameter to match your grommets and fit plugs. Cut out a 13 ¾” x 13 ¾” square on the side of each PAX unit that faces your bed. Position the square just above the level of your mattress to make it a convenient height. Insert the EKET cabinet into the square and secure it in place with from inside the PAX wardrobe. Caulk around the front edges where the EKET meets the PAX to create a sleek finish. Place your LEDs, if you’re using them, and run any cords through the holes in the back. Mathilda applied a to the sides of the PAX and the wall behind her bed to further enhance the custom look. You could do the same, or you could leave them white, or paint them. That’s it! Admire your work, and pat yourself on the back! Before cutting into the PAX, carefully measure to ensure you don’t go too large. Also, as with any IKEA hack, once you cut a hole out of the PAX, you void the warranty. A hole could also compromise the structural integrity of the unit, so consider reinforcing it or securing it to the wall (which you should do anyway). To level up the look a bit, you could add trim around the cube. If you don’t want to sacrifice as much space inside the PAX, choose the .

{"title": "Tiny Room? This IKEA Desk Hack Frees Up Floor Space Fast", "content": "Who says you need a lot of floor space for your furniture? If you’re squeezed for space and need a work station, this wall-mounted desk hack from Mette Nagy Stovner has you covered. You just need a little room on your wall, and you’re in business. Mette looked at the IKEA , but it wasn’t the look she was going for. So, she did what any hacker would do; she figured out how to get what she wanted by making it herself. And what she came up with was simple, clever, and quick. Mette took the humble IKEA IVAR cabinet and, with a quick flip (literally), gave it a sleek upgrade. A few tweaks later, and she has a space-saving, stylish laptop and workstation. If you’re looking for a hideaway home office or homework spot, you need to . Hang the IVAR Cabinet on the wall at the desired height with the appropriate hardware. It’s best to install it directly into the wall studs. Use the appropriate anchors for the wall if there’s no stud. Use the hanging instructions for the cabinet provided by IKEA as a guide. We have a wall-mounted desk and cabinet, and one thing we took our time with when installing it was the height. Remember, you’re planning to use it as a desk, so you don’t want to hang it too high. When we hung our wall-mounted desk, I sat in the chair I planned to use, and we marked where we wanted the desk surface to land on the wall. We measured up from there for the hook placement, etc. I would think a similar technique would work here. One of the concerns that showed up over and over in the comments was about the stability of the desk. Mette added decor chains on each side of the fold-out for extra support. Many people feared it would come out of the wall as soon as someone leaned on it or put too much weight on it. However, Mette responded, saying, “The chains hold up to 24 kg, so I think that would be enough for arm support! If not, we will upgrade to better chains, I think. The test runs this weekend have gone really well for both kids and adult use! But if one has kids who climb on furniture, I would consider further support.” I have to say, I share the concerns. We found out the hard way that we didn’t have enough support with one of our drop-down desks. The chain itself didn’t break, but the weight of the desk pulled it out of the cabinet part. We had to get , and we haven’t had a problem since. Though Mette did not mention it, you’ll probably need a to keep the fold-down desk in upright position. Also, drill new dowel holes for the horizontal shelf. The IVAR shelf is slightly shorter than the height (now width) of the frame, so longer may be necessary. Those three steps were pretty much the entire hack, pretty simple! But there’s definitely a lot more you could do. For example, the upper door adds hidden storage. But if you needed it to stay open, you could add some . This would be useful if you needed to keep a larger monitor in the cabinet. As-is, several commenters mentioned that a monitor would not fit. But if you left out the shelf, added stay-put hinges, and considered mounting the monitor to the wall, through the back of the cabinet, that would be pretty cool. Otherwise, Mette designed it as more of a laptop station, so she didn’t need this step. If you have items with cords, a cut-out in the bottom makes it easy to slip cords through, allowing the cabinet to close flush. You could also adjust the look of the cabinet to suit your decor by adding a wood wax, stain, or . What do you think of this ? Is this transformation of an IKEA storage staple a win?

{"title": "This Pet Parent Built a Dog Ramp Out of IKEA Furniture—And It’s Adorable", "content": "Whenever I’m working in my office, my pup is usually curled up in the corner chair, my constant canine coworker. If I gave her a way to get on my desk, I don’t think I would get anything done. She’d curl right up on my keyboard. But this from gives their pups front-row seats to their workday. Now, I love the idea of providing your pups a safe, easy way to reach high places, especially as they get older. It’s a lot easier on the joints than jumping. So, this attached to IKEA’s TARVA nightstand makes a lot of sense. R1Alvin’s cute doggos don’t want to miss out on any action, and they love to watch the squirrels outside. The ramp gives them the leg up they need, and it looks like they have a lot of fun playing on it, too. If your pets love to be by your side 24/7 (and in your face), then this could be just the hack you need. This hack would likely work with any similar nightstand, but presuming you bought the TARVA, go ahead and put it together. Position it with the back next to whatever area you’re trying to give your dog access. This is the meat and potatoes of this hack. Cut the plywood to size. The hacker made theirs roughly half the width of the . Play around with a few options for the length, but you want it to give your dogs a gradual incline. Make sure you have enough space alongside the TARVA to maneuver around the ramp. Cut the 1 x 2 into several pieces that match the width of your ramp. Attach them to the plywood ramp using the threaded nuts and wood glue. This provides the pups with some steps and slip guards. Although, since you’re going to add padding, you may decide you don’t need them. R1Alvin also added a 2×4 brace and extra plywood to the bottom for support and stability. Use the angle brackets to attach the ramp to the side of the TARVA nightstand. Choose an angle that matches the incline you need for your ramp. R1Alvin didn’t have any carpet to cover the ramp, which they said was slippery for their pups. Therefore, they used a bathmat and some straps. You could use foam, cushions, carpet, whatever you think looks and works best in your space. R1Alvin didn’t stop with a simple dog ramp. Once they realized their pups used the ramp, they added for an extra bit of fun. Plus, they started brainstorming some other ideas, saying, “I can build out the top of the nightstand into a small dog pen, but raised high where it’s nice and secure. After that, paint the top of the crate green so it looks like a tree. Tree Woof Fort.” You really could take this idea and run with it. Turn it into the , create a cozy raised den, or even connect a few TARVA nightstands and make a doggy obstacle course. What do you think of this hack? How about this or these ?

{"title": "Overpriced Oak Bedside Shelves? Here’s a $20 IKEA Hack That Looks Just as Good", "content": "Oak bed shelves. Beautiful, warm, minimal. But also? Surprisingly expensive—and perpetually out of stock. That’s what happened here. So instead of dishing out the moolah, Ole made one using an . The result? A sleek, wall-mounted bedside shelf that looks high-end, fits perfectly in small spaces, and costs a fraction of designer alternatives. This hack doesn’t just save money, it’s great for holding your book, phone, or a small light. Let’s show you how to make it This hack transforms the square EKET into a rectangular open-front box, resembling a custom oak shelf. Here’s how it comes together: Decide how tall you want the final shelf. Use a pencil to mark the new lines on two opposite sides of the EKET cabinet. This determines the new dimensions, essentially reducing the box’s height. Carefully saw the two selected sides down to size. EKET panels are constructed with a laminate veneer over a cardboard honeycomb core, so once cut, you’ll need to dig out that inner material to make room for support. Cut wooden strips to fit snugly inside the hollow areas you just exposed. Around 40mm (approx 1.5 inches) thick should do. Apply wood glue liberally and secure these support strips flush with the interior. This strengthens the structure and makes it possible to cut the angles in the next step. Let the glue dry completely before moving on to the mitre cut. For a seamless look, cut your edges at a 45-degree mitre. Laminate can break easily, so go slow and use painter’s tape over your cutting lines to reduce chipping. Align the angles, apply glue, and assemble the box. Once dry and secure, your new shelf is ready to mount. Because wall materials vary, choose the right anchors and screws for your specific situation. If in doubt, consult your local hardware store or a handy friend. Assuming you’ve got access to basic tools, this project should take about 2 hours, an afternoon at most. The main expense is the EKET cabinet itself, which is $20 for a unit. You may already have a few bits of wood and glue lying around. Compared to , this IKEA hack is a budget win. This shelf hits that sweet spot: modern and minimal, yet sturdy and functional. Ole says, “It’s the perfect size and not intrusive.” That pretty much sums it up. It fits a book or two, your phone, a small lamp, maybe . No legs, no clutter. Just clean, practical style hanging right where you need it. And the best part? The size. It’s not too deep, not too wide—just right for the space beside your bed. The most delicate part of this project is cutting the laminate panels without damaging the surface. If you’re nervous about your sawing skills, practice on scrap or consider using a with a guide rail. Precision is key to getting those tight, 45-degree corners.

Other adjustments came into play when Matthew had to create a custom height for one of the open fridge cabinets, and he had to account for a sloping ceiling and walls that weren’t perfectly square.

But the solution came in using the panels to help trick the eye into making everything look straight. Matthew also had to work with certain things that were already in place from the general contractor, like outlets.

{"title": "This Beautiful Built-In Adds Instant Elegance Without Breaking the Bank", "content": "Custom built-ins typically cost thousands, making many homeowners assume they’re reserved for luxury homes and people with money to burn. But what if I told you that your dream of having a beautiful built-in bookcase was only a DIY project away? Mia of @ turns a few BILLY bookcases into a stunning built-in unit complete with firewood storage. IKEA hacks featuring the ever-popular BILLY bookcase have shown countless ways to create a custom masterpiece without a high-end price tag. For Mia, a budget-friendly built-in was the perfect way to put their personal stamp on their new home. The home was built in the early 2000s and had white walls, light floors, and basic materials. It was a clean, minimal look that didn’t really fit their style, so they decided to add a little timeless elegance and character with this . The project fits their limited budget and provides a custom, built-in storage area for books and firewood. The creator devoted a lot of time to the design part of this project, which turned out to be a good idea when it came to the actual build. But they point out that the setup does have a lot of flexibility, admitting that using four 15 ¾” or two 31 ½” BILLY shelves would have worked equally well. Therefore, plan out your design according to your space to figure out the best setup for you. Sketch out ideas and measure carefully to decide on the best configuration before you start making anything. Mia suggests working backwards when it comes to building the firewood storage piece. To determine the necessary dimensions, consider your ceiling height, the height of the BILLYs, and the size of your baseboards and crown molding. Select a hardboard that has the same thickness as the BILLY bookcases to maintain a uniform look. Build the firewood storage out of the masonite. Add extra walls to the firewood storage to match the extra thickness of where the different BILLYs meet. Mia mentions, “Dividers in the firewood storage were added for aesthetics and structural support.” Put together the BILLY bookcases according to IKEA’s instructions. Patch any unused holes and sand the entire unit to get it ready for painting. Set the BILLY bookcases on top of the firewood storage and attach everything to the wall to secure it in place. Prime everything with an adhesion primer. Allow the primer to dry, then paint the shelves and firewood storage. Mia opted to paint everything the same color as their walls. However, you could pretty much do anything you want when it comes to color, depending on the look you’re going for. After painting, add hardboard panels to the sides to finish off the look and give it that built-in feel. The addition of baseboards (that match the rest of the baseboards in your house) and crown molding also contributes to the custom, built-in look. Fill any seams, then paint to create a seamless, smooth finish. The hacker used an electrician to add an LED strip at the top of the shelves. However, there are also that could provide the same look if you don’t want to foot the bill for an electrician. After buying the BILLY bookshelves and other supplies, you could recreate this hack for about $350 to $500. This is a steal when it comes to custom built-ins (not counting the cost of an electrician). The creator also offers this final tip to keep your creation looking beautiful: “Place baking paper at the bottom of the firewood storage to protect the paint. It’s barely noticeable and easy to replace when needed.” Want to recreate this hack? , and make sure to follow Just a scandi (@ ) for more clever DIY magic or to find out more about how they created this piece.

But the only corkboard mats I found on the US IKEA site were the . So, just worth keeping that in mind if you decide to tackle this hack. Use a jigsaw (Marlena recommends a fine blade) to cut out the flower pattern on one placemat. If you don’t have a jigsaw, you can use a sharp mat knife, but take your time to get a nice, clean cut. Use a rotary bit if you have one (or the mat knife) to cut out a circle in the middle of the mat the size of your socket. For the other placemat, cut out individual petals. Paint all of the pieces, both sides, whatever color you desire. Marlena painted everything white (her paint is from MissPompadour GmbH ) for a fresh, clean look. But you could change the color, use several hues, add a pattern, etc. I would imagine the corkboard loves to soak up paint, so a paint and primer combo would likely be a timesaver and limit the number of coats you need. Allow the paint to dry completely before moving on to the next step. First, glue the individual petals around the complete flower, layering the pieces slightly to create the 3D effect. Let the adhesive dry before putting the pendant on the socket kit. Slide your brand-new flower shade onto an existing socket if you’re swapping out a shade. If you’re creating a completely new fixture, you’ll need to purchase a . You can find these kits in all sorts of different styles. No matter what your design preference, you can find a socket kit to help alter the look of your DIY fixture and match it to your favorite aesthetic. For example, maybe you want to give your flower pendant a vintage look. Perhaps you prefer to give it a more industrial edge. Note: Make sure to choose the proper bulb for the lamp kit you get. If you love this idea, but you can’t find the SVARTVIDE placemats in the States and don’t want to order internationally, don’t despair. You could purchase online. The only pitfalls here are the size and the lack of a flower pattern laid out for you. The only similarly priced mats I saw were 12 inches, whereas the SVARTVIDE mats are about 13.6 inches. But you could likely find some larger ones at a local home store or for a few more bucks. As for the pattern, you would have to assess your drawing skills or find a similar pattern that you could trace onto the mat. It potentially adds a couple of extra steps, but it’s not impossible.

{"title": "Keep Your Vinyl Records in Line with This Ingenious Shelf Stopper Hack", "content": "Jeff Richards has found a simple yet effective solution for vinyl record collectors who use IKEA’s Kallax cubes to store their albums. With just a few inexpensive materials and minimal effort, Jeff has created the , a hack that prevents records from sliding too far back in the cubes. Jeff’s motivation for creating this hack was simple: “I was tired of the records sliding too far back whenever I put another record onto the shelf.” With the KALLAX vinyl backspacer, vinyl enthusiasts can now enjoy a tidy record collection lined up neatly without the hassle of constantly adjusting their albums. Best of all, it’s extremely easy to hack. Here’s what you need to do: 1. Jeff used a Polystyrene White Case Moulding, which he cut into 13 1/4″ long pieces using a hand saw or chop saw to fit the width of the KALLAX shelf. 2. He applied glue to the back of the molding and aligned it to the edge of the shelf. The lip of the molding should hug the edge for a clean finish. “It takes very little glue and it will dry overnight perfectly,” Jeff explains. “As long as the pieces lay flat, they will not need clamping.” 3. Fill shelves with records. The hack is not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing. “It looks like it was made that way,” Jeff says. “It works perfectly and keeps your record collection looking its best.” One of the best aspects of this hack is its affordability and ease of execution. According to Jeff, “Nothing was hard. This is a fifteen-minute project that lasts forever.” The materials cost just $6.96 for a piece of 8-foot-long molding. The amount needed depends on the number of KALLAX cubes in use. With 8 feet of polystyrene molding, you can create seven pieces. We love how neatly his records sit on the KALLAX cubes. This hack is also a good one for lining up paperbacks and books on the KALLAX or . What do you think? Will you be adding this handy ?

{"title": "The Clever Hack That Makes Changing Diapers Easier", "content": "When I was planning my son’s nursery, I remember gawking at inspo pieces that boasted spending thousands on their baby’s room. We were working with a much smaller budget, so a $1,000 changing table (or even a $500 one) was not an option. Therefore, I appreciate repurposing other pieces, as Maxi Marie ( ) did with this IKEA KALLAX changing table hack. If you’re trying to stretch your dollars in your baby’s nursery, I think the changing table is one of the easiest things to DIY. For me, I found a second-hand dresser, solid wood, loaded with storage. My husband sanded and painted it, and we swapped out the hardware and added a changing pad on top. Maxi Marie uses this same concept with the , going a step further and adding wheels. The popular KALLAX shelves were one of the last year, so it’s easy to find plenty of . The unit provides opportunities for storage (always a must in a nursery) and a smooth, flat surface for taking care of business. The best part is that this hack is simple, giving you more time to work on your nursery’s finishing touches. This step is optional. You might decide to leave the KALLAX as-is. It comes in a few different finishes. However, if you decide to paint, use a quality paint-and-primer combo. Since the finish is so smooth, look for a paint that works with multiple surfaces. Even if it says no sanding is necessary, give the KALLAX a light sanding first to rough it up a bit. Drill holes in each bottom corner of the KALLAX and install the wheels. Make sure you use castors with brakes so the changing table doesn’t rock and roll while you’re changing diapers. Use heavy-duty adhesive Velcro to attach the pad to the top of the KALLAX. Look for a to add an extra layer of safety. Some pads also come with safety straps. Test the pad to ensure it is secure and doesn’t slip and slide. Use the boxes or baskets of your choice in each cubby to hold diapers, wipes, spare clothes, and supplies. You can change up the storage by adding a or the KALLAX doors. There are also different drawer inserts available and many , so you have a lot of flexibility in how you want to set up your storage. Maxi Marie also hangs a rod on the side for additional storage. I did the same thing with my DIY changing table, but I used a basic towel bar. When babies are involved, DIY projects take on a whole new level of commitment. It’s not just about looking good and functioning. You need to make sure it’s safe and secure. Most of the comments on this hack were positive, thinking the idea was clever and functional, especially if you’re living in a smaller place. I also love the idea of a mobile changing table. I think back to how much easier it would have been to wheel the changing table into our room at night when our son was sleeping in his bassinet. Or how during the day I could have it in the living room or anywhere else I was with my son. The creator points out getting wheels with brakes. However, what several commenters worried about was the narrow footprint of the KALLAX. They wondered if it would cause safety issues, imagining the baby would easily fall off the side. Honestly, I’ve seen changing tables about the same size. I’ve also heard unfortunate stories of babies falling from large changing tables. The rule when changing a baby is always to keep one hand on them at all times, no matter what the size of the table. So if you’re going to do this hack, just stay cautious and remember the basics. Also, since most typical changing pads will overhang the sides of the KALLAX by about an inch, use enough hook-and-loop and always make sure it stays secure.

The biggest problem with collecting figurines is your collection becomes a major dust magnet. My mom bought me a glass display case for the unicorns, but I remember it cost a pretty penny. But what if you could find a simple, affordable way to solve this dusty dilemma? This IKEA hack from showcases how to turn the popular SANNAHED frame into a stylish display case. I love this idea because of its simplicity, low cost, and short tool list. All you need is a utility knife. If you’re new to DIY, this is a great starter project, and it’s versatile. The hacker uses it for their collection, but you could use it for any type of mini figures or collectibles. Remove the back of the frame and the protective film from the front plastic. Take out the square insert, and remove the matting. You won’t need the matting for this project, so feel free to save it for another fun DIY creation. The primary focus of this hack is the square insert, which becomes the shelves for your figurines. Cut the insert into four pieces (a commenter suggests using a craft knife to cut at the corner seams). According to another, the insert pulls apart easily. Replace the plastic front. Then, slide one insert back into place on the interior side of the frame. The other pieces are for your shelves. You’ll likely only use two, depending on the size of your collectibles. Personally, my husband and son both suffer from major dust allergies, so the less dust, the better. Plus, I hate dusting, so anytime I see a way to lighten my chore list, I get excited. If you have a small collection that you love to display, but you’re tired of the perpetual layer of dust, give this hack a try. To keep your figures upright as you replace the backing or you decide to hang the frame, use a little . A small piece on the bottom of each one should help secure it to the shelf. This hack has over 149,000 likes. I can see why. I mean, it’s not only a neat idea, but it’s quick and easy and a bargain. Since all you need to create one display case is one SANNAHED frame, the cost remains an affordable 9.99 plus tax. The other reason this DIY project is so well-received is because it’s a breeze to adapt it to your personal preferences. The SANNAHED comes in several colors, and it’s also available in a larger 19 ¾” x 19 ¾”. One commenter suggested adding an extra step, saying, “Hear me out: this but with a cute background and maybe some fake grass or fabric on the shelves.” Others quickly chimed in with their enthusiastic responses, recommending colorful backdrops, painting the shelves, and making themed surroundings for whatever you plan to display. Many people mentioned wanting to to create a special case for their LEGO minifigs. This was exactly what I first thought of when I saw it because my son has minifigs coming out of his ears.

{"title": "The Picture Frame Hack That Lets You Enjoy New Artwork in Seconds", "content": "I’ve had my eyes on changeable frames like this for a while now. I figure they would make it easier to show off my son’s ever-growing collection of artwork, but a lot of the ones I’ve seen get pricey. That’s why I love this hack from Debbie ( ) which highlights the popular IKEA FISKBO frames. It seems like I’m not the only one. With over 175 likes, this quick project has commenters praising its cost-effectiveness and simplicity. You don’t need any expert DIY skills or fancy tools, and as for your IKEA list, you just need two FISKBO frames. I’m going to pick up some during my next pitstop to the Swedish superstore so I can make my own. The first step is to connect the two frames using your trusty drill and hinges. Debbie offers a word of expert advice for this step, saying, “Make sure the hinges are the right size and that the screws are not too long.” You don’t want pointy screws poking out the front of the frame. Use a ruler and pencil to mark your matting and cut it according to size. Place one solid piece in the back of the picture frame to help support the artwork. Alternatively, you could use the backing that comes with the frame since you won’t see it once the artwork is in place. Cut another piece of mat board to create the matting for the front frame, making sure that it hides the black tabs. Drill two small holes in the middle of the frames and insert a pin magnet into each. Secure the magnets with hot glue, and now you can open and close your crafty DIY frame in a snap. I feel like placing the closure opposite the side with the hinges would make your picture the most secure. You won’t have to worry about it slipping out from between the frames, which means you can swap out artwork even more quickly. Place your picture of choice into the frame, and hang it as you normally would. Now you can open and close the frame to change up the current picture without having to rehang anything. Easy peasy. The great thing about this hack is you can tweak it to fit your own needs (and artwork). The frames come in several sizes and colors, or you can to create an artistic gallery wall that shows off your unique style. Plus, the FISKBO is designed to hang either horizontally or vertically, so it’s ready for anything. My son does a lot of drawing on regular 8.5 x 11 sheets of paper, but he’s started transitioning to larger works. Therefore, I think I’m going to also try this hack with the large , or maybe even the 19.75 x 27.5 (he just got a brand-new giant sketchbook). There are smaller frames, too, if you prefer mini masterpieces. You can also adjust the size of your matting to add even more variations to the mix. Now, when your budding Picasso brings home another masterpiece, it’s easy to swap it out and give it some time in the spotlight. It’s like being a quick-change artist with a twist. in action and make sure to follow Debbie on Instagram for more inspiring ideas and DIYs.

{"title": "This Hack Is Bringing Bread Boxes Back … and Not Just in the Kitchen", "content": "I remember a shiny silver bread box on my grandparent’s kitchen counter, and yes, they kept bread inside it. But nobody really uses them anymore, at least not for storing bread. However, that doesn’t mean bread bins are out of style, as this cool hack from proves. Don’t get me wrong, a bread box actually helps keep bread fresh, but I personally don’t want to sacrifice the counter space. I’d much rather find other uses for these MAGASIN bread bins, and it appears I’m not alone. After checking out this hack, I did a quick peek at other bread-box DIYs, and let’s just say, they keep on coming. If you’re looking for a way to create a space-saving TV stand or , then here’s the idea for you. Use a bread bin (standing on its side) to mark the curved shape for the ends of your bottom and top pieces. Make the pieces as long as you want, as long as they’re both the same. Then, cut two smaller pieces for the interior side walls (use the bottom of a bread bin to measure this). Cut a third piece of wood for the middle shelf. Screw the side walls onto the lower panel through the bottom so you don’t have screw holes. Attach the middle shelf to the side walls, then screw the bread boxes into position on each side, putting the screws on the inside of the bread bin. Use the wood glue to attach the top panel and clamp it in place. (The hacker doesn’t use clamps, but I find it helps make the bond stronger.) Add screws from below, then remove the clamps once it’s secure. Screw the hairpin legs onto the bottom of the unit. Tape around the handles on the bread bins and paint them black to match the legs. These IKEA bread bins turn up in plenty of hacks. You can put two bread boxes side-by-side to create a smaller table or nightstand. Or put one on top of the other to create a . However, with 202,500 likes, this MAGASIN bread box console from Alexander Johnson certainly stands out. Some commenters felt this piece is a bit too small to provide enough storage, but I say, it all depends on what you need. IKEA has the measurements for one bread bin as 15.75 inches long, 10.25 inches deep, and 6.75 inches tall. That might be just right for a loaf or two of bread, but what about to hide your clutter? Well, when you flip it on its side for this hack, it gives you a cabinet that’s 6.75 inches wide, 20.25 inches deep, and 15.75 inches tall times two. Since Alex decided to make the piece larger than the typical double-cabinet hack, you also get the shelf in the middle. This extra shelf is perfect for displaying accessories or for extra storage. If you want to keep things hidden, use baskets or bins. You could also add an interior shelf in the bread boxes using . Overall, this hack gives you storage in a slim, space-saving design that looks stylish and modern. Adjust the overall length of your TV stand by cutting the boards longer.

This upcycling project, which Matteo calls the “EXPEDIT Bike Furniture,” offers a budget-friendly alternative to pricey, specialized bike storage systems. “I decided to hack an 5×5 that I didn’t need anymore at home to organize the basement space better,” Matteo explains. He adds, “On the Internet, there is similar storage furniture for bikes and cycling accessories, but these are usually fashion items.” Which didn’t work for him. The beauty of this hack lies in its simplicity. With just eight L-brackets, screws, and a bit of creativity, Matteo has given new life to an old piece of furniture. The hack works equally well with the newer , making it accessible to a wide range of IKEA enthusiasts. The assembly process is straightforward, with a few tweaks to the standard instructions. Matteo advises, “Follow the standard assembly instructions but stop at the first level allowing enough space to accommodate your bike.” Finish assembling the entire frame structure of the EXPEDIT or KALLAX unit. The key to creating the bike storage space is in the clever use of the “small squares” (the individual cube dividers) and . To prop the bike up, install two cubes using the shelves and provided dowels. Secure the top shelf with L-brackets. Use two inserted into the dowel holes to hold the bike tires in place and keep the bike upright. If the exposed particle board bothers you, finish it with a strip of before inserting the dowels. Sealing the exposed edges will also make the setup more durable and easier to clean. For those looking to maximize their hack, Matteo offers a bonus tip: “With the remaining parts and some additional L-brackets and screws it is possible to create an additional 2×5 furniture.” See our collection of ideas on . While the project itself was smooth sailing, Matteo did face one challenge: space constraints. “The most critical point of this hack was the space available to assemble the furniture. My basement is narrow (in fact I could not capture the final result in a single shot),” he shares. Matteo is thoroughly pleased with the final result and the storage it provides. He concludes, “I’ve got so much stuff in the basement. For sure, I’ll fill them with the bike accessories (shoes, helmet) and the spare parts.” He found a win-win solution that declutters his basement while creating an organized station for his two-wheeled companion. What we love about this hack is how it showcases the bike, almost like an art installation. If you love your bike, this hack gives it the stage it deserves. For those who prefer ground-level storage, this hack works equally well on the bottom shelf, sparing you the effort of lifting your bike. Install the cubes at the top for storage instead.

For Sabrina, her search was for the ideal console table. “Unfortunately, I could not find the perfect console, so my husband had to believe in it again and build one himself!” she shared on her . After realizing that the perfect entryway console was nowhere to be found, the couple decided to take matters into their own hands rather than settle for a less-than-perfect option. For their project, the couple went to IKEA and bought two long LACK shelves measuring 110×26 cm and two shorter ones at 79×26 cm. They also got a couple of double-headed nails and flat connectors to ensure a sturdy construction. The assembly process was straightforward. The longer shelves were designated as countertops, while the shorter ones would be transformed into legs. To begin, they carefully marked the locations on the shorter LACK shelves where the longer ones would be bolted. They drew lines above and below each shelf and identified the midpoint, creating a guide for where the double-headed nails would be inserted. Then, they hammered the double-headed nails into place along the midpoint line, using the tool provided for the task. Once the nails were in position, they centered the longer shelf above and pressed down firmly. “You have to hit it a little harder,” Sabrina explains, highlighting the need for a bit of extra force to ensure a solid connection between the shelves and legs.

Like many home decor enthusiasts, I found myself caught between my champagne taste and lemonade budget – until I came across ‘s IKEA hack. She transformed the affordable IKEA GURSKEN nightstands into a sophisticated storage sideboard that may just be the thing I’m looking for. On its own, a single hacked GURSKEN might not amount to much. But when you place five of these hacked beauties in a row? Now that’s something spectacular. Repetition, my friend, is the key to creating drama. “By repurposing the shelves as fronts and incorporating folding hinges, we’ve created a completely custom piece that serves our specific storage needs,” she explains. The hack centers on the IKEA GURSKEN bedside table, which retails for just under $20. The project requires six to seven nightstands, depending on which method you use to make it. The transformation involves several key steps, assuming you want to end up with 5 GURSKEN units with doors. Method 1 is easier but will cost you an additional GURSKEN unit, which I think is worth paying, for so much less work. Assemble 5 GURSKEN nightstands as per instructions and set aside. The simplest approach to create door panels is to repurpose three of the horizontal panels of a GURSKEN unit as doors. By using two GURSKEN units, you can obtain a total of six panels. If you’re working with a budget, it’s essential to maximize the resources from a single GURSKEN unit. Here’s how. Assemble 3 GURSKEN nightstands and set aside. Next, open the other two GURSKEN boxes (4th and 5th) and remove the bottom panels from both; these will be repurposed as doors. Open the last (6th) GURSKEN box which is our sacrificial unit.

{"title": "A Quick Fix Makes This IKEA Outdoor Storage Box So Much More Accessible", "content": "The IKEA NÄMMARÖ storage box serves as a practical solution for the garden and balcony, functioning well as an outdoor storage box and bench. Made from acacia, a naturally durable hardwood, it is pre-treated to withstand the sun, rain, stains, and general wear and tear. However, the loose lid can be a pro or con, depending on your specific needs and space configuration. For John Sharpe, the design was a bit of an inconvenience. “The original box has no hinges,” he explains. “You need to remove the lid completely to access the interior. My box goes against a wall in my courtyard, and it needed something to hold the lid open while I got out my garden tools.” This can be less than ideal when your hands are full with spades and shovels, making the process rather cumbersome. John’s quick fix to the NÄMMARÖ storage box allows for a more convenient and efficient way to access his tools. Here’s what he did to turn the loose lid on the IKEA outdoor storage box into a hinged top. John explains the strut puts some stress on the hinges when closing the lid. “Longer hinges might be better – or add another two hinges,” he says. For those looking for a more professional finish, consider insetting the hinges into the wood for a flush look. While this isn’t necessary, it can add a polished touch to your project. Lastly, if your NÄMMARÖ will be kept outdoors, keep your garden tools dry by placing them in plastic boxes, such as SAMLA, inside the storage box. With this simple upgrade, your NÄMMARÖ storage box can become a more efficient addition to your garden. And it still works as a bench. Your tools are more easily accessible when you need them. I used the IKEA NÄMMARÖ Storage Boxes to make two cat housing boxes to be placed outdoors. The cat box also doubles up as a bench seat. We set up these cat boxes as a refuge for the 4 cats in the colony I have in my backyard. It’s not a litter box but a place for them to sleep, to get away from the cold. They all live outdoors.

Well, it looks like IKEA has been taking notes. They’ve recently introduced a new add-on to the range: an , which, in my books, is a cheeky nod to the DIY IKEA hacking community. This add-on isn’t just any desk; it’s a space-saving WFH component that seamlessly fits into your BILLY bookcase, creating an efficient desk and storage solution. By day, it’s a pop-out workspace; by night, it’s a cozy dining table for two. And when all is done, push it back in, and voilà —it recedes into the background—well, almost. The BILLY desk add-on is sold for $50 in the U.S., even cheaper than the compact . Nevertheless, it won’t stand alone, as the runners that allow the desk to be pushed in and pulled out need to be installed to the BILLY frame. Material-wise, IKEA cuts it from the same particleboard as the BILLY. However, the support rails and the front two legs, which need to be sturdy, are made from solid pine. That’s good for us DIYers, as it means you can quite easily strip off the white acrylic paint from the legs, stain or paint them, and personalize them. The table height is 29 1/2”. You need to install the slides to the 8th and 9th dowel holes on the BILLY frame, counting down from the fixed middle shelf. IKEA makes no mention of this, but we think it should fit the standard 31 1/2” wide BILLY, even older versions. Let us know in the comments if that’s not the case. You can install short BILLY doors on the upper section of the bookcase. Open shelves are best for the area under the desk. The BILLY drawer will fit but may be cumbersome to access as the legs will be in the way.

A desk provides a convenient surface for browsing books, taking notes, or engaging in research, creating a more cohesive and efficient study or reading area. In , it provides a dedicated study area that doesn’t permanently occupy floor space. Home offices in spare bedrooms can also benefit from this setup, allowing the room to quickly transition back to guest accommodations when required. You could even set it up in the kitchen for an impromptu recipe-reading stand or in the hallway for a pop-up command center. Learn more about the . In 2011, Lena shared her clever BILLY desk concept with us, which is a simpler alternative to IKEA’s current design. Her approach utilized L-brackets attached to the BILLY frame to support a wooden board, complemented by two VIKA KAJ table legs at the front. While this idea remains practical, modern updates could elevate its style. Consider using a solid wood board with striking grain patterns and pairing it with more contemporary legs, such as the sleek HILVER model, to refresh the look. If IKEA’s new BILLY desk doesn’t quite meet your needs, is a versatile option that allows for greater flexibility in creating a workspace that fits your home and work style. If you prefer a wholly hidden WFH setup, then this stealthy IKEA bookcase desk hack is for you. The desk part extends out when pulled down and is supported by hinges and brackets.

{"title": "When IKEA Becomes the Hacker: Classic POÄNG Gets an Official Makeover", "content": "Swedish furniture giant IKEA has introduced a fresh take on one of its most iconic designs, the POÄNG armchair, as part of its Nytillverkad collection celebrating the company’s 80th anniversary. The new low-back version of the beloved chair aims to blend nostalgia with modern sensibilities, offering a more social seating option for today’s homes. The Nytillverkad collection, which means “newly made” in Swedish, revisits and updates some of IKEA’s favorite designs from the past. While many classics have disappeared from IKEA production lines, the , along with the KLIPPAN sofa, has remained a constant presence in IKEA stores for decades, proof of their enduring appeal. Originally designed by Japanese designer Noboru Nakamura over 40 years ago during his three-year stint with IKEA in the late 1970s, the POÄNG has now been reimagined without its signature headrest. This modification transforms the chair into a more conversation-friendly piece, ideal for “chatting, debating and collaborating,” according to IKEA. The low-back POÄNG maintains the chair’s distinctive curved wood frame but offers a new silhouette that fits seamlessly into contemporary interiors. IKEA is offering the updated design with frames and cushions available in a variety of colors including red, birch/beige, and black, allowing customers to either match or mix styles to suit their preferences. This refresh of the POÄNG is not just a nod to IKEA’s history but also a tribute to Nakamura, who passed away in 2023. His designs, particularly the POÄNG (originally named POEM) and the sofa, have become synonymous with IKEA’s commitment to functional, accessible design. The reason for its longevity, according to Nakamura, was its simplicity in design. “You know the Japanese flag,” he explains in a . “It’s just a round circle. It’s so simple. I like to approach my design in a similar way. If it has too much individuality, there will inevitably be two sides to it: the people who like it and the ones who don’t.” As IKEA continues to evolve and adapt to changing lifestyles, the introduction of the low-back POÄNG demonstrates the company’s ability to honor its heritage while meeting the needs of a new generation of furniture buyers. IKEA sells the new low-back POÄNG at $99, in stores and online, alongside its classic high-back counterpart which costs upwards of $129. While the new version represents a refreshing addition to IKEA’s lineup, the company hasn’t specified how long it will remain in production, so get it while you can. You have an old high-back POÄNG but love the new low-back version? Well, we’ve got you covered. All you need to do is to shorten it and eliminate the headrest. And voilà, you got yourself a “brand new” POÄNG low-back armchair. What’s better than a POÄNG armchair? Apparently, three POÄNG armchairs in one. If you want a 3-seater bouncy sofa, see this for the details. The POÄNG’s bentwood armrests are its most striking feature but they can do with a wee bit of improvement for more comfort and function.

{"title": "Turntable Stand with Front-Facing Vinyl Record Storage (Makes Album Flipping A Breeze)", "content": "I love IKEA products for their simplicity, clean lines, and suitability for endless creative uses. I particularly like the and the (especially frames) for creating custom combinations for storage and furniture. Having used several iterations of BESTÅ media consoles for stereo systems, I have always been frustrated by the way a standard Vinyl LP Album fits in a standard BESTÅ 15” drawer or storage space. You can put the albums on edge in a BESTÅ cabinet on a shelf, and they will fit front to back, and you can put a 15” door to cover the front of the space for esthetics; however, it’s hard to look through and select the records since you are looking at the stack from the side. It would be nice to have a drawer to pull out, like a filing cabinet, where you could put the albums in it facing the front so you can flip through them like in a record store. You would think the 15” BESTÅ drawer would be suitable for this, but after the drawer slides and mounting considerations, it turns out to only be 10” deep. So … I came up with this hack in order to make the drawer deeper so it would hold an LP album. It turns out that fully 3” of a 15” drawer front extends below the bottom of the drawer box in order to cover the slides and to fulfill the 10/15 standard space of the 25×25 BESTÅ form factor. This IKEA hack uses a pan to extend the bottom of the drawer to utilize this space and be able to fit a 12×12 album in the drawer. While the materials in this write-up are for my particular BESTÅ adaptation to create a , the hack is really for modifying the 15” drawer to hold record albums. You can adapt this to your own creation using different drawer fronts, different colors, and different or multiple combinations of placement in a BESTÅ system. Also, you may be able to find a less expensive pan to use – the only critical thing about it is the dimensions and that it should have some sort of lip to support it in the opening you cut out. This hack with the tray will not work if you want to install the drawer at the bottom of the cabinet. The bottom of the tray is just shy of the lower edge of the drawer front, so it will clear a drawer below it; however, since drawer fronts typically overlap the top and/or bottom edges of a BESTÅ frame, the tray will not clear if the drawer is on the bottom. Assemble the drawer and the drawer front per the instructions. Although it would seem logical to cut the hole in the bottom before assembly, having the drawer fully put together provides stable support for the bottom as you cut the hole. Unwrap the baking pan and remove the sticky label at the bottom. Make a pattern for the opening that needs to be cut in the drawer bottom. You can’t just trace the bottom of the pan because the sides are sloped, and the hole would be too small. I used some scrap cardboard taped together under the lip of the pan. Transfer the pattern to the bottom of the drawer. It should be reasonably centered. Cut out the opening. I used a drill for pilot holes in the corners, a small skill saw for the long cuts where I could, and a jigsaw for cleanup (you can use whatever tools you have at hand that will do the job). Do not try to cut the opening the EXACT size of the pan – either leave a little play in the pattern you make or cut to the outside of the line if your pattern is exact. Otherwise you will end up “adjusting” the opening in order for the pan to drop in. Flip the drawer over and drop the pan in the opening. The pan should lie flush with the bottom of the drawer. If the opening is too tight, adjust it with a file, sandpaper, or saw (see Tip in Step 5). If the fit is reasonably snug, you are done. You can add a dab of glue or double-sided tape under the pan’s lips if you want, but I didn’t find it necessary. Assemble the drawer into the BESTÅ Frame as normal. Place your favorite LP Albums in the drawer and enjoy! If you fill it only about ¾ full, it’s easy to flip through the albums like you would at a record store to select the one you want. Depending on how stable your cabinet sits on the floor, you might want to consider anchoring the back of the cabinet to the wall so it won’t tip when you open the drawer loaded with vinyl.

Rosemarie, who shares her innovative projects on her Instagram account @ , unveiled two EKET hacks that are “slap-forehead” easy and may spawn a trend of flipping IKEA around. She says on her Instagram, “What can’t you do with EKET cubes? Because all sides are equal in length, there are endless possibilities.” First up is Rosemarie’s simple yet effective storage bench. For this, she used 13 3/4″ EKET cubes. The flip-top chest is a larger EKET cabinet with a door (13 3/4 x 13 3/4 x 27 1/2″). By combining EKET cabinets of varying sizes and orientations, she’s created a multifunctional piece that offers both seating and storage. The genius lies in its versatility – some cubes face upwards for easy access, while others face forward, providing a mix of open and closed storage options. She drilled a simple hole in the EKET door to serve as a door pull. A cushioned top transforms the 2-cube EKET into a bench seat. She used an MDF board as the base under the EKET cabinets but says it is optional, “Not a must, but it looks a bit better as if the furniture belongs together.” This storage bench hack is a terrific project for DIY beginners and would be awesome for . Moving on with the same concept, Rosemarie recreates it in the bedroom, producing a bedside storage unit that sits flush with the bed frame. This clever idea offers easy access to books, stuffed animals, and other bedtime essentials, right next to the bed. By elevating the EKET cabinets on an MDF base, Rosemarie ensures that everything is perfectly positioned, streamlining bedtime routines for parents and little ones alike. With the cabinets facing upwards, their doors become additional surfaces, ideal for placing a bedside lamp, a glass of water, or a favorite toy. Rosemarie’s hacks prove having a fresh perspective is key to IKEA hacking. By flipping the standard front-facing EKET shelving unit, she’s unlocked a whole level of possibilities.

On her Instagram channel, , she transforms the simple shoe storage unit into a functional garden hose box. This easy and quick hack hides away the garden hose and helps keep her outdoor space looking spick and span. Here’s a step-by-step guide to achieving this nifty garden hose hideaway cabinet. For this IKEA hack, the TRONES unit will be installed over the water tap. Start by marking the exact location of the water tap on the back panel of the TRONES unit. This will indicate where you need to cut a hole to accommodate the tap Use a hole saw (or drill) to make the initial hole, then a jigsaw to carefully cut a larger hole in the back panel of the TRONES shoe cabinet. This hole should be large enough to fit the tap through. Wear safety glasses and a face mask while cutting to protect yourself from flying debris. With the hole cut, position the TRONES shoe cabinet against the wall where you want to install it. Use a pencil to mark the spots where you’ll need to drill holes for the screws. Drill the holes, insert wall anchors if needed, and then screw the TRONES unit securely into the wall. Use a spirit level to ensure the installation is aligned and level. Next, you’ll need to modify the drawer cabinet to accommodate the garden hose reel. Use a pencil to mark the edges of the cabinet. Cut away the back of the drawer cabinet to create space for the hose reel to fit through. Make sure the cut is clean and smooth to avoid damaging the hose. Reinstall the drawer cabinet back into the TRONES frame. It should work as usual and, when closed, look like a regular shoe box.

{"title": "This IKEA Hack Will Have You Sitting Pretty (Literally)", "content": "Looking to elevate your home décor without breaking the bank? Say no more. just dropped a brilliant IKEA hack that’s stylish and functional. It’s not easy to replicate, but it can be done with the right tools and some DIY skills. Hannah transformed three units into a chic corner dining bench, maximizing both style and storage in one fell swoop. Here’s how she did it, step by step: Hannah began by building a sturdy wooden base to raise the KALLAX (15 3/8″) to a perfect seating level. Regular bench heights are around 18–20 inches. The base ensures that the structure is high enough for dining use. Although it’s not shown in her reel, I would recommend adding a plywood or MDF (Medium-Density Fiberboard) board on top of the wooden base. This addition would serve as the bottom of the KALLAX units, preventing storage items from falling through to the base. Next, she put together three KALLAX units according to IKEA instructions. Then, Hannah placed them on top of the wooden base, with the cubes facing up. To ensure the bench doesn’t wobble, Hannah attached the KALLAX units to the walls and each other. Hannah scribed the back edge of the MDF to achieve a seamless built-in fit against the wall. This technique involves marking and trimming the MDF to match the contours of the wall, creating a seamless look. Here’s where the magic happened. Hannah designed and cut out curved shapes on the MDF panels for the open end of the bench and the corner where the two KALLAX units meet. IMHO, these curves truly distinguish Hannah’s project from a . They then made supports for the curved corner and secured them to the end of the KALLAX units. Finally, Hannah trimmed and sanded all MDF panels for a smooth finish. In the comments, she mentions that the MDF tops are to the KALLAX, which means you can lift the top up to store things inside the KALLAX. She says, “It’s just a little awkward as you have to remove the cushions, and the table is in the way too, but it’s there if you want it.” They cut Pole Wrap to fit the entire length of the bench seat, including the curves. Before gluing them on, they treated the panels to a whitewash. “We just used watered-down white paint to whitewash, which helped take the orange tinge away,” she explained. The pieces were then trimmed and glued onto the sides of the KALLAX units, seamlessly merging them with the MDF sides and bottom to create the look of a built-in dining bench. For the finishing touch, Hannah created two cushion seats, one straight and one L-shaped, to cover the entire banquette. She trimmed the foam to size, using the bench as a guide. The foam was adhered to an MDF board, and the fabric was stapled into place and pulled taut to ensure a smooth, professional finish. Lay the cushions on the bench seat, and there you have it: a chic dining bench with storage. We love the hack’s dual functionality. Not only does it provide seating, but it also incorporates ample .

{"title": "Cat Owner Hacks IKEA KALLAX into Cat-Approved Climbing Tower", "content": "Forget flimsy store-bought cat trees. Savvy cat owner Samanta has conquered the high cost and low quality of commercial options with a clever IKEA hack. Using two KALLAX shelving units and some creative thinking, Samanta built a “Cat Castle,” a multi-story cat tower fit for her two large cats. “Commercial cat trees are just too expensive and weak for my two active cats,” Samanta explains. Driven to create a sturdy and stimulating environment for her cats, she embarked on a 3-hour IKEA hacking project. The total cost? A budget-friendly €150 (approximately $160), a fraction of the price of a high-end cat condo. The hack starts with a solid foundation. Samanta secured the first horizontally to a wooden base, ensuring stability for the climbing structure. Next, she strategically placed two store-bought cat trees onto the KALLAX, serving as pillars for the second level. The final touch involved carefully setting the second KALLAX unit on the cat trees, creating a multi-level playground. She added another cat tree with a perch above the upper KALLAX unit for even more height. But how did Samanta ensure the upper KALLAX stayed securely in place, given the KALLAX is famously hollow? “We used M8 bolts to secure the KALLAX units to the two short cat trees,” she explains. The smaller cat trees, , come with an M8 bolt fastening system on both ends, making this part of the hack easy. The trees are also wrapped in sisal rope, especially for cats. The large cat tree pillar, which held up the other end of the KALLAX, was a different story. This centerpiece was Samanta’s creation. She used a cardboard cylinder covered in sisal rope for the exterior of the tower and a sturdy wooden core to support it. This step is crucial in ensuring the cat tower supports the weight of the KALLAX unit. “We cut into the cylinder, creating a notch to support the KALLAX and fixed (the KALLAX) with screws to the internal structure of the cylinder,” she explained. The extra step in securing the upper unit guarantees the stability of the entire cat tower, creating a safe and wobble-free zone for her playful kitties. The result is a “strong and big enough” castle that can comfortably accommodate Samanta’s two adult cats. The upper KALLAX placement was the trickiest part, she admits, but it was worth the extra effort. Now, the tower provides a sturdy top level for the cats to climb and play. Samanta is thrilled with the final product. “Looking back, I wouldn’t change a thing,” she says. She’s not the only one who likes the ; her cats absolutely love it. They spend hours climbing, napping, and looking down on humankind from their new multi-level cat castle. Samanta completed the DIY cat tower with a , and non-slip mats on the platforms. Shelves and perches were also added to the cat trees to complete the cat playground.

There are so many choices out there, but many of them just don’t quite hit the mark—either they’re not very practical or just not that cute to look at, or they are painted in colors that don’t quite work for your room’s decor. Henna Luokkanen, a crafty DIYer who shares her projects on , took matters into her own hands and turned a classic white IKEA toddler bed into a cute boho piece. “I wanted to have a wood-colored bed for my daughter that doesn’t cost an arm and a leg,” Henna explained. So I thought, why not do it myself?” The hack involved restoring the bed to its original state by stripping its painted surface to reveal the natural wood grains. While not every IKEA toddler bed lends itself to such a transformation, the SUNDVIK extendable bed—with its main parts made from solid pine—was the perfect candidate for this IKEA hack. Bet you didn’t expect that. Here’s how she did it. The process began by sanding down all the white components of the bed frame using various sanders and grits of sandpaper. “First, I sanded down all the pieces of the solid pine frame that were white, excluding the middle portion of the footboard and headboard. Those parts are not timber,” Henna shared. Employing a trio of sanders – a Bosch , an Ozito Random Orbital Sander, and a Skil – along with sandpaper of varying grits, she meticulously smoothed the surfaces to prep them for paint. “I would probably be able to use only one sander, but I wanted to explore the differences because I didn’t have previous experience before this project,” she explained the different sanders. Once all the wood pieces were sanded, it was time to stain. “I used Cabot’s Benchtop Paint for a clear satin finish,” she revealed. With each component well coated in natural wood tone, she let them dry thoroughly before assembling the bed. “Then I soaked the ,” Henna explained. “It is easier to attach and not so stiff to work with when you soak the rattan first.” Employing a staple gun, she mounted the supple rattan to the bed headboard and footboard, creating a rustic, organic texture to the plain toddler bed. “After that, I cut moldings to a 45-degree miter joint and added them on top of the rattan, creating a frame that makes the edges look better,” she described. Bullethead nails secured the moldings in place, with any exposed nail holes concealed with spackling paste for a seamless finish. As a final flourish, Henna glued onto the bed frame using adhesive, adding decorative embellishments. The result is a unique, textured toddler bed with bohemian flair. “I love the overall look and the rattan details I added,” said Henna of her handiwork. Henna’s rattan bed makeover looks good as the star of her toddler’s bedroom. What used to be a plain white IKEA bed is now a super cool boho-chic piece. The natural wood colors and woven rattan detailing fit with the rest of the wooden furniture and earthy vibe. Before the makeover, that basic white bed would have looked so out of place and stuck out like a sore thumb against all the warm, natural tones in the room. But now, with the rattan weaving, light stained wood, and carved embellishments, it blends in beautifully. The textured rattan goes perfectly with the grainy wood, creating a cohesive nature-inspired look. What we love most is how accessible this hack is, with no need for complex tools. You only need to sand the parts down to expose the wooden bed, then stain in the shade you want. Easy peasy. The best part is that even with the upgrades, the SUNDVIK bed still has that extendable feature to grow with her kid. So you can bet this upgraded bed is going to last her little one for years to come. Henna leveled things up in the cutest way possible.

{"title": "From Diapers to Desks: 3 Ideas for Repurposing A Changing Table", "content": "Liskat, a creative DIY enthusiast, shared her journey of repurposing an IKEA STUVA (now called SMÅSTAD) changing table into a versatile desk with storage. What started as a changing table for her daughter grew into a multi-functional desk and bookcase, giving this IKEA piece many more years of use. One fantastic aspect of the STUVA changing table is its versatility, allowing you to lower the top shelf and convert it into a desk once your child is no longer in diapers. You get “two” pieces of furniture in one. And that’s exactly what Liskat did. However, she found it somewhat lacking upon converting the STUVA changing table to a desk position, which sparked a series of mini hacks to customize it to her daughter’s needs. Here’s what she did: I bought a STUVA (now called SMÅSTAD) changing table when my daughter was born. I loved it as it provided a very high, stable, and deep space to keep everything I needed on hand. Once we no longer needed the changing table, I lowered it to become a desk. However, it suddenly felt almost a little too roomy and deep and not very desk-like. As I had already customized it by painting the drawers gray (now a standard color, but not sold by IKEA at the time), I was reluctant to trade it in for something else, so I decided to give it another small makeover. Initially, all I did was add a narrow shelf at the back of the desk, resting it on the raised sides of the desk. I used a white wooden strip I left over from a previous project and added a to keep things from falling off. I also used a couple of LÄTTHET over-the-door hooks to hang stuff off the desk’s side. Time to do this? Approximately 5 minutes. After a while, I started wondering how I could make better use of the space under the ledge I had created and decided to add drawers. I found three mini-drawers from the (two narrow and one wide) were just the right width. The drawers were a smidge too tall, so I had to add very thin wedges (5mm, max) to raise the ledge. I am glad how they turned out as they are extremely spacious and hide a multitude of junk … er, I mean very important and knick-knacks. The original ledge was too narrow, so I had to get a new one cut to size at the hardware store. Time to do this? It took approximately 5 minutes to assemble, not including the time to go to IKEA and the hardware store. One thing I really liked about the STUVA was how deep it was and how many toys, books, etc. I could fit into it. So, when I started running out of space at the desk, I decided to use another to make a matching bookcase. I searched the classifieds and found one for free (handy since they were giving it away without the changing table /desk bit, which I didn’t need). I didn’t like leaving the top open as it looked “unfinished” to me. All it took was a measuring tape, a trip to the local hardware store to buy a white shelf and get it cut down to size, some extra strength furniture tape, and hey presto, I had myself matching furniture. I couldn’t go to IKEA to get extra drawers since I had painted them myself (and who can remember what shade of gray I used!), so I removed two drawers from my original changing table/desk and slotted them into the new STUVA bookcase. How long did it take? It took 10 minutes to assemble, plus the time it took to collect the second-hand unit and the trip to the hardware store. I am very pleased with these small (and very easy!) tweaks that will allow us to extend the life of this furniture and enjoy it for a few more years. Next on the agenda? Adding doors to hide the top of the bookcase. I’ve already bought the hinges and the most adorable rainbow door pulls … Stay tuned! ~ by Liskat Anne’s IKEA SMÅGÖRA .

{"title": "Bright ideas for the IKEA wooden figure", "content": "The IKEA GESTALTA artist’s figure is a classic, posable wooden mannequin that is often found perched on the desks and shelves of artists and enthusiasts alike. Traditionally used as a reference tool for capturing the complexities of the human form in drawings and paintings, this simple yet versatile figure has become a staple in the creative world. However, GESTALTA’s potential extends far beyond its initial purpose. Creative minds around the globe have repurposed and transformed this unassuming piece into a myriad of artistic expressions. From elaborate to functional home decor and even as a canvas for intricate art projects, the GESTALTA is the starting point for fun . Portland artist Daniel Ward unveiled a charming sculpture called “Flying Man,” transforming the humble IKEA GESTALTA wooden figure into a marvelous piece. The GESTALTA is a wooden figure commonly used by artists for drawing or as a decorative piece. The GESTALTA, with its basic wood finish and posable limbs, serves as the perfect canvas for Ward’s creative process. This tutorial will provide you with a step-by-step approach to creating your own version of this unique IKEA hack. Begin by positioning your IKEA GESTALTA model into the desired pose for your sculpture. To help maintain this position throughout the sculpting process, glue scrap cloth strips to the wooden figure using wood glue. This will also provide a textured surface for the clay to adhere to more effectively. Once the cloth is in place and the glue has set, cover the model with air-dry clay. Sculpt the clay to add details and features to your figure, transforming it from a simple wooden mannequin into a dynamic “Flying Man” or whatever pose you prefer. After the clay has fully dried, spray a coat of clear lacquer to seal the surface and harden the clay. This protects your sculpting details and prepares the figure for painting. Apply layers of acrylic paint glaze to bring your “Flying Man” to life. Be patient and allow each layer to dry before applying the next to achieve a rich and detailed finish. Seal your paint job with another layer of clear lacquer. Cut strips of office printer paper and cherry wood to build the harness and wing framework. Glue the pieces together securely and allow them to dry completely. Once dry, you can paint, stain, and lacquer the framework to give it a finished look. Use CA glue to meticulously adhere tissue paper onto the cherry wood framework for the delicate wing membranes. Apply multiple coats of lacquer to strengthen the tissue. The final step in the construction process is to prepare the base for your sculpture. Cut a piece of cherry wood to your desired size for the base. Stain it and apply a coat of lacquer for a glossy finish. Once the base is ready, drill a hole to accommodate the figure’s original metal support. This will secure the figure to the base and complete the sculpture. Daniel took about 3 weeks to complete the entire sculpture process. This is just a jumping-off point. Feel free to add your own artistic flair with different poses and materials. So, grab an IKEA GESTALTA figure and prepare to let your artistic creativity fly. A few weeks back, John spotted the and felt an instant desire to add it to his collection. However, his wife wasn’t convinced. ‘There’s no use for it!’ the wife says. So, John came up with an ingenious use for the IKEA GESTALTA wooden artist dummy. He transformed it from a decorative item into a useful one: a . He first dismantled the wooden figurine and then made holes through the body and limbs for the wires. “I got a couple of 3W Luxeon LEDs, took the GESTALTA apart, and wired it up through the limbs. I used a BASISK table lamp base, left over from a friend’s other project, to hide the electronic stuff,” he explained. Taking it apart was easy, but putting the Pinocchio back together was a nightmare. He used the base of an old IKEA lamp to house the electronics and set the model figure on. John tested the brightness of the lamps without the lens, (pic, left) but the exposed LED was too harsh on the eye. With the lens cover the light was softer and more pleasant.

She transformed the simple storage solution into a multi-functional kids’ loft bed and play den for her two children, showcasing the project on her Instagram account . For this hack, she used two SMÅSTAD wardrobes and a 4-drawer module to serve as pillars for the loft space. The design features a cozy bed nestled beneath the loft, with another bed on top, providing each child with a private sleeping space. The loft space is not just a place to sleep; it also includes a charming reading nook on the other end where the kids can indulge in their favorite stories. She used the TOLKNING handmade rattan headboard for the lower bunk to surround the bed head. One of the most innovative aspects of Chia’s IKEA hack is the , which doubles as bookshelves and storage drawers. The stairs are custom-built but made to fit the size of drawers.

The design blends in so seamlessly that you might miss it unless the homeowner reveals its secret storage. Lee was quick to point out that they didn’t DIY it themselves. “We had the idea, and local tradesmen pulled it off.” Unfortunately, a detailed tutorial isn’t available, but Lee’s pictures offer valuable insights into building your own hidden PAX closet. Studying these visuals lets you gather key tips and techniques to get you started. Lee and his family were fortunate to inherit three from the previous homeowners when they moved into their new house, which required some renovation. These wardrobes became the foundation of a on their top-floor landing, adjacent to three bedrooms. Due to their location in the eaves, the bedrooms have , so traditional storage solutions weren’t ideal. The PAX wardrobes offered a perfect way to utilize the space efficiently without intruding on the bedrooms. Yet visually, they needed to blend — better yet — disappear into the surroundings. The solution was to transform the PAX units into concealed wardrobes hidden in plain sight. The salvaged PAX frames were without doors. The contractors cut MDF boards to fit the size of the frames and routed door hinges. (You can use for this step. Using IKEA all the way will be easier and save you a step, but IKEA doors may not be as cheap as MDF boards.) They closed off the space above the PAX wardrobes with boards for a clean finish. and trim were added to the doors, mimicking the trim along the landing space. The contractors chamfered the trim and chair rail to allow the doors to open fully. To continue the illusion, they omitted door handles and installed push openers. Then, to complete the visual trickery, painted the doors in the same two colors as the walls. Due to the upcycled PAX wardrobes, the project was extremely cost-effective. Lee spent around £650 ($820) for new doors, materials, and labor costs for the two contractors. Even with three new wardrobe frames, the cost of the project would have increased by a mere £240 ($510). The entire transformation, including painting, was completed within a three-day period. Lee finds the transformed space incredibly functional, especially considering it was previously unused. He loves seeing the expressions on the faces of his guests who discover the hidden storage in what appears to be a hallway. “When people come in, they are amazed to see the doors pop open with a slight push, and they notice all of the clothes inside,” Lee says. He shares that Sunderland Joinery was the contractor behind this project, bringing their expertise in joinery and custom furniture to this bespoke IKEA project. “Michael was amazing and really let my ideas come to light,” Lee adds.

{"title": "Football-Themed Boys Bunk Bed Makeover on a Budget", "content": "Kirsty Haslam’s eldest boy finally wanted a bed of his own, and not any boys bunk bed, but a football-themed (or what some may call soccer) room. Kirsty came up with a clever hack to turn her son’s existing IKEA KURA bed into a bunk bed — gaining extra sleep space and a play area without using much floor space. A bunk bed is also great for sleepovers. In her Instagram account , she guides us through the step-by-step process of turning a standard KURA reversible loft bed into an adorable bunk bed with a football theme. If you’re buying a new bed, start by assembling the KURA bed. You’ll want to utilize the reversible bed in the low bed position, making use of the bunk bed frame to create the top bunk. Use the 4×4 wooden batons to create a frame around the top of the KURA bed structure. This will add strength and stability to the bunk bed. Secure the batons with screws to ensure a solid foundation. Add extra struts down the back of the KURA bed for additional support. This step is crucial for ensuring the bunk bed is secure and safe for use. Secure the modified KURA bed to the wall for added stability. Use appropriate screws and anchors to ensure a firm attachment. Cut the 25mm thick MDF sheet to fit the top of the KURA bed. Screw it securely in place, creating a sturdy base for the top bunk. Construct a frame from the top of the KURA bed to the ceiling. Make sure to check the direction of your ceiling struts and attach the frame accordingly for maximum support. Attach a specialized kid’s cargo net to the frame using cable ties. This creative touch not only lends to the football theme but also serves as a fun and functional safety feature. The net works like guardrails, only cooler. Paint the football bunk bed in your kid’s favorite color or your child’s favorite team colors. Alternatively, create a unique football-inspired design to further bring the football theme home. Kirsty’s color of choice is from Lick (Blue 04 and 17). Kirsty Haslam’s project cost £311 ($390), including the IKEA KURA bed, MDF, timber, and the . Not bad at all for a custom kid’s bunk bed.

Rachel Martino of , hacked together a speakeasy-style using BILLY bookcases, LOMMARP cabinets, and a lot of ingenuity. At first glance, the cabinets appear to be elegant arched display cases with closed storage below. The magic happens when she pulls the bottom section to reveal a bar cabinet. The bar cabinet is movable, so you can place it in front of the bookcase or anywhere in the room if you so wish. We love how this ingenious design disguises the functional bar until “Happy Hour” comes around. The base of the bar consists of three LOMMARP cabinets. Two are connected as a movable unit and outfitted with six heavy-duty caster wheels on the bottom, allowing the entire bar cabinet to slide out from under the bookcases. The third LOMMARP cabinet remains fixed under the wall-mounted BILLY bookcases above. All 3 cabinets are covered with a marble countertop for an ultra-chic finish. Rachel got creative with the BILLY bookcases, flipping them upside down and securely attaching 2 of them to the wall. Her contractor then mapped out the arches on 1/2-inch plywood and cut them to fit. She added decorative trim along the curves for visual interest. A plywood toe kick at the bottom hides the bar cart’s wheels. To transform the bookcases and cabinets into a cohesive bar design, Rachel sanded and primed them with a shellac-based primer. She then painted the pieces a bold pink hue called paint. She finished with multiple coats of polyurethane to protect the new paint job. Clever handles were installed underneath the countertop, allowing Rachel to pull the entire bar cart out from under the bookcases with just a few tugs. When not in use, the bar discreetly disappears back into the wall space. While not a cheap DIY project, the total costs came up to way less than the $12K she was quoted for this custom design. With some affordable IKEA furniture and creative problem-solving, Rachel crafted a hidden home watering hole that works hard as a storage display cabinet by day and a bar counter by night. Beyond the clever transformation, Rachel also outfitted the bar with luxe details, like wall sconces, acrylic pull handles, and gold orchid drawer knobs. Her followers loved it. “Absolutely love multifunctional furniture and spaces. This is so beautiful!” says one commenter. Another says, “Being so creative is a superpower.

Since then, I used a with the HÖGSMA top to put my laptop during photoshoots (with my camera tethered to it for instant image review on a bigger screen) and to store some smaller stuff. Over time, I became a bit annoyed with it due to the following reasons: Long story short, as 2023 came to an end, the tether cart was getting too small. With a rough idea in mind, I compiled the following shopping list to build my new Tether Wagon. First, I assembled the BROR Trolley following the standard instructions. The only modification I made was flipping the bottom shelf over, creating a shelf with “walls” to prevent smaller things from falling off while moving it around. Next, I mounted the STUBBERGET to one corner on the long side of the trolley and set up the 27” monitor. For the , my initial plan was to attach it using double-sided tape or zip ties, but I realized it’s essentially a painted particleboard. After some measurements, I drilled holes where the screws of the BROR (short side) are located. I decided to mount the SKÅDIS on the right side of the BROR. The square SKÅDIS Pegboard is 1cm wider than the BROR trolley. I mounted it with an equal overhang of 5mm on both sides, but it doesn’t really show. After drilling the two top holes, you can unscrew all of the screws on the short side, mount it using the two holes you already drilled on the top, and then use the holes in the BROR as a guide to drill the rest of the holes. It’ll save you some measurements. But be careful where you place your fingers while drilling. You could probably get away with just drilling 4 holes, but since there were additional holes for an alternative mounting of the lower shelf, I drilled 6. I used the screws that came with the BROR hooks for those, as I attached the hooks with the standard screws. Next, I measured the width of the keyhole-shaped mounting holes of the KOPPLA extension cord and drilled two holes through the metal of the “first” shelf on the BROR. Two screws later, I was able to slide the KOPPLA onto it. As a second-to-last step, I mounted the BROR Hooks on the left side of the Wagon. One is to hold the cable of the KOPPLA when not in use, and the other is for my USB-C tethering cable. As a final step, I used a stick-on KALKSTUFF cable holder on the back of the STUBBERGET Mount to secure the monitor’s HDMI cable. And so it was done—the Tether Wagon 3000, as I lovingly called it.

That’s the challenge facing Ehami, a Japanese DIY Instagrammer who shares her transformations on . Living in a rental, Ehami wanted a solution aligned with her approach of using removable and non-damaging methods and materials. Her thoughtful response to this dilemma was the creation of a functional and stylish DIY kitchen island that could be easily assembled and taken apart without altering the original condition of the rental. She already had an IVAR cabinet (19 3/4″ / 50 cm deep) for a few years and decided to use it as the kitchen island’s main base. She added two shortened IVAR side posts and two IVAR drawers to the structure. This new structure is next to the IVAR cabinet to extend the island’s footprint. The island is placed in front of the existing kitchen setup, forming a and separating the kitchen and dining areas. Once she had the base in place, it was time to enclose the island. Ehami built a U-shaped frame using pine wood and battens. She constructed the frame to fit snugly over the IVAR units. On the open end of the U, she installed shelves to create an integrated , adding extra storage and display space. She comments that the IVAR is quite strong, even on its own. “The enclosed U-shape makes it snug, and the depth is 50cm so that it won’t sway from side to side at all,” she replies to those concerned about the sturdiness of the kitchen island. She made another board to cover up the front for the open space below the drawers. Items are accessible from the back of the unit. To finish off the island, Ehami used Reatec, a durable, realistic, and flexible architectural film on the surfaces. Reatec provided a simple (but not inexpensive) way to add color and durability to the IVAR and pine surfaces. She chose a neutral cream color, the one she used on her kitchen table. The result was a functional and beautifully finished DIY kitchen island within Ehami’s budget. She transformed her kitchen into an organized workspace by getting creative with modular storage units and simple enclosure and finishing techniques. The integrated bookshelf at the open end added extra practicality, too. Her followers love it, and her DIY has inspired others to do the same. One commenter says, “It’s amazing! I had just moved to a place and it did not have a perfect kitchen counter, so things were scattered all over the floor. So I was thinking of making one; I’ll give this a try!” Another says, “I feel like I want to change the inside of my house again.” Her project was picked as one of the .

{"title": "How to raise the IKEA stackable bed for storage", "content": "We have an IKEA stackable bed in the guest room and love it. The only problem is that the legs on the UTÅKER bed frame are so short that we cannot store anything . Also, because of the short legs, you are limited in the height of the (bottom) mattress when the beds are stacked, and the indicated maximum mattress height (12 cm/ 5 inches), in our opinion, is not comfortable. That is why I decided to replace the legs with new, taller ones. In a nutshell, I cut new legs in the length I wanted (added 10 cm/ 4 inches per bed), copied the holes from the original legs, reused the hardware, and assembled the beds back together. Read on for details of our UTÅKER IKEA stackable bed hack. If you only want more room for a thicker mattress, you could change the legs for one bed and increase the length to the top of the bottom bed. (Please note that the jigs I made are based on adding length to the bottom of the legs). If you only want to make room for storage under the bed, you could only change the legs for one bed and increase the length on the bottom. If you choose this option, you cannot use the two beds as a double bed since the height will be different. That is why I chose to increase the height of all 8 legs. The beds will remain identical and interchangeable and can be used stacked as 2 twin-size beds or as 1 double bed. Please note that the total height of the stacked beds will be higher, so it will be less suitable as a daybed/ couch. The original legs of the bed are 40mm x 40mm and have a height of 20cm. They have big radii (±R20) on 2 corners. I used planed wood with a dimension of 44x44mm, a standard available size in hardware stores. Since I use the outsides to line out the holes to have the boards flush with the legs, the total bed will be 8mm wider and 8mm longer with these legs. This was not an issue for the assembly of the beds or fitting of any of the other parts. The radii on the legs are just decorative; the bed is also usable with square legs. I chose to put a radius on the outer corners with the biggest round-over bit I had (R9mm), but this is totally optional. New leg (left) vs. original leg (right): The beds both have a side with a high board and a low board. This results in 4 different legs, and IKEA marks them (on the bottom of the leg) with A, B, C, and D. There are 2 different holes in all legs – ⌀8,1mm holes, 17mm deep, for the wooden dowels – ⌀7,5 mm holes, 27mm deep, for the pre-assembled hardware (screw-in nuts), with a (counter)sunk edge of ± ⌀ 13mm. These holes are in different locations on the legs. To copy them, you can use one of these 3 options: Make sure to align the measurements to the outside of the leg (closest to the row of holes; this will ensure the boards will be flush with the legs) and to the top of the leg. I numbered the holes/ jigs as below. As you can see, 3 different patterns (1, 2, 3) are used on the left and right sides of the legs (L, R). If you don’t have or don’t want to use any of the printing options, you can take the measurements from above and copy them onto your legs. All dimensions are in mm. To make life just a little bit easier, you can on a true scale and glue them onto your legs. Always check a few dimensions on your printed drawing to see if the scale is 1:1. The contains 4 pages, with 1 jig per page; jig 2 is double because you need it twice. Print out all 4 pages for 1 set of legs. Ensure you align your print with the outside (12mm dimensions) and the top of your legs. If you have the opportunity to print out the jigs with a 3D printer, that is (in my humble opinion) the easiest and fool-proof method. There are 3 jigs that can be used to align to the left or right side of the leg. You can push it against the sides, align the drill with the holes, and drill through them. The files are . After all this theory, it is finally time for the steps to get the job done: The original height under the bed is 10cm (on the high side B-D). To fit a big SKUBB box, I added 10 cm, which makes the total leg 30cm long. You can choose any length; the jigs measure from the top of the leg. Make sure you drill perfectly straight (drill press recommended) so all the hardware will fit with the boards. To not mess up the different sizes of holes, I drilled all 7,5mm holes first, then made the (countersunk) collar on them, then drilled all remaining 8,1mm holes. The beds work and fit perfectly fine with square legs, but if you want to have them look more like the original ones, you can use a router and a big round-over bit to add a radius to them. You can also do this step before cutting the legs to length. I did it after; it makes for a more stable part for drilling. If you attach the legs to the head/feet board of the bed, you have a piece that is easy to clamp down and run a hand router or palm router on. The size depends on the feet you have available. Make sure it will easily fit the furniture feet at the bottom of the other bed with some play. These feet are not only used to protect your floors but make sure the beds remain in place when they are stacked. I drilled the holes deeper than the thickness of the feet so the wooden legs of the two beds would make contact when stacked. These nuts/ inserts are pre-assembled to the legs when you buy the bed. You can remove them with a size 6 HEX key. Assemble the nuts you just removed from the original legs into the ⌀7.5 mm holes (the ones with the collar) of the new legs.’Assemble the nuts you just removed from the original legs into the ⌀7.5 mm holes (the ones with the collar) of the new legs. I was afraid that the beds with the higher legs would not be as stable and that, especially stacked, they might wobble. But luckily, this is not the case; I do not feel a big difference between the modified beds and the original ones. I hope this is helpful to anyone hoping to raise their IKEA stackable bed. Here’s how the IKEA stackable beds look after it’s all done. The IKEA stackable bed offers numerous benefits for those seeking an efficient and versatile sleeping solution. The IKEA UTÅKER stackable beds consist of two individual bed frames that can be easily stacked on top of each other to create extra sleeping space. This innovative design brings numerous advantages to various settings, such as , kids’ bedrooms, guest bedrooms, or any space requiring extra sleeping accommodations. One of the main benefits of stackable beds is their space-saving nature, unlike bulky bedroom furniture that may not properly fit small bedrooms. And much easier to DIY compared to a . By stacking multiple beds vertically, these beds utilize the available space efficiently. Unlike traditional beds, stackable beds do not take up unnecessary floor space, allowing you to maximize the functionality of your room or living area. This feature is particularly valuable in small apartments or shared rooms with limited space. Moreover, IKEA stackable beds are incredibly versatile. They can be easily rearranged according to your needs, changing the configuration to a single bed, a queen bed, two twin beds, or a corner sofa daybed. This flexibility allows you to customize your sleeping arrangements depending on the number of guests or occupants in your space. Another advantage of the IKEA UTÅKER bed is its durability. Made from lightweight solid pine, these wooden beds are built to be easily stacked and unstacked without compromising their structural integrity. This durability ensures a long lifespan for your stackable bed, making it a wise and cost-effective investment. Furthermore, IKEA stackable beds come unfinished, allowing you to DIY them to suit your taste. You can use glazing paint, oil, paint, or stain to protect the surface and stamp your unique style to your bedroom decor. Lastly, IKEA stackable beds are known for their affordability. Stackable beds are generally more budget-friendly than other furniture beds on the market. The two IKEA bed frames with included slatted bed bases come up to almost $250. Your choice of mattresses will bump the price up, but it is still a good bargain. This affordability makes them an excellent choice for those on a tight budget or individuals needing temporary or guest sleeping arrangements. The only downside of the stackable bed is the lack of a headboard and footboard, which is not a big problem for most. You can easily add an upholstered headboard and line up pillows along the wall to create a plush headboard. Another issue is its short legs, which do not allow for storage under the bed. The good news is the IKEA UTÅKER bed hack above solves this problem. The IKEA UTÅKER bed reviews are mainly positive, with over 92 5-star reviews. Buyers love it for its space-saving feature, minimalist design, and how it unstacks into a big double beg. Buyers recommend measuring the mattress size in advance to ensure it fits the bed dimensions. The benefits of IKEA stackable beds are manifold. They save space, offer versatility and storage solutions, provide durability, come in various styles, and are budget-friendly. Whether you need an extra bed for guests, a space-saving solution for a small room, or a flexible sleeping arrangement, IKEA stackable beds are a practical and efficient choice for any home or living space.", "author": "Jules Yap", "date": "2023-09-15T06:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://ikeahackers.net/2023/09/ikea-stackable-bed.html", "categories": ["ikea-hacks"], "tags": ["ikea", "hack", "diy"], "image_url": "https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ikea-stackable-bed-with-storage-768x432.jpeg", "excerpt": "We have an IKEA stackable bed in the guest room and love it.

Instagram user showed how she elevated her washing machine and dryer off the floor using IKEA kitchen cabinets. It’s a fantastic way to blend the laundry section with the kitchen, especially if you already use an IKEA kitchen. Saskia was searching for affordable washing machine stands but found options were either too short or too expensive.

Saskia showed how, with minimal materials from IKEA, anyone can create a custom-sized laundry center workstation that makes the space much more functional. The affordable and straightforward is perfect for small laundry rooms or apartments. For those wondering whether the laundry appliances have “bounced off,” Saskia assures that the laundry appliances are doing fine and have not moved. Nevertheless, she notes this IKEA hack may not be suitable for all washers and dryers. She has a quiet washing machine that “does not walk” during cycles, which is a significant consideration for this DIY washer and dryer pedestal project. For heavy machines or washing machines that produce significant vibration during spin cycles, the METOD cabinets alone may not provide enough stability without additional reinforcement. Those with older or unbalanced load washers/dryers may want to consider adding rubber vibration pads between the machines and cabinet, locking casters, or bolting the unit to the wall for safety. The hack works well for Saskia’s set-up, but homeowners should evaluate their own equipment’s vibration levels before attempting this hack without extra precautions. Vibrations over time could potentially cause the cabinet or machines to shift if not properly secured.

Tips and ideas on how to use IKEA products, which may not necessarily be made for laundry, to make a laundry room look great. A washer and dryer pedestal provides numerous benefits over having the appliances sit directly on the floor. It elevates the machines to a more ergonomic height for loading and unloading, preventing users from having to bend over or squat down. This can help reduce strain on the back and knees. A pedestal also allows for additional storage space, providing a handy place to stash detergents, fabric softeners, baskets, and other laundry supplies within easy reach. For smaller laundry rooms or apartments where counter space is limited, a pedestal keeps these items neatly tucked away while freeing up valuable surface area. Pedestals also protect flooring by lifting the machines slightly off the ground, reducing vibrations, noise, and wear and tear over time. Overall, a well-built pedestal creates a more organized and user-friendly laundry zone. Most quality pedestals sold are designed to hold the weight of standard top-loading or front-loading washers and electric or gas dryers, usually between 100-250 lbs each.

The drawer beneath is used for . But our oldest is growing bigger and is now really into . After receiving all of his Dad’s old LEGO bricks from his childhood, we needed good storage space for all the building blocks. So we thought why not convert the playroom set-up into a small LEGO room? A space where we could organize and (more) easily find the pieces by color and build old sets from still-saved instructions. But also have the space to be more creative. A LEGO room is a dedicated space for your LEGO hobby. It’s a space to keep your bricks organized and contained, providing a fun and creative environment for building and displaying your work. It can occupy a small corner, a spare room, or an entire basement. It’s up to you and here are a few ideas to get you started. We wanted to keep the old setup of the play area with the SMÅSTAD desk and drawer and needed a quick but practical solution for brick storage. We could’ve stacked some on the table, but we thought this wouldn’t be practical, and not quite polished. Tossing a few ideas around we finally landed on this. We cut down the sides of the SMÅSTAD toy storage drawer, so there was a bit more space above it inside the desk. We finished off the cut edges with U-profiles. Inside the desk, we fixed a shelf with drawer slides. The shelf was made of an old piece of leftover furniture panel. To prevent boxes from sliding (and bricks scattering all over) we added a piece of VARIERA drawer mat on top. After having to pick up one box of LEGO bricks that had fallen off the back of the shelf, we ended up adding a corner profile at the back of the shelf, to prevent further LEGO catastrophes. We filled both spaces with a variation of KUGGIS boxes and two SAMLA boxes (one with LEGO bricks and one with ). Also added an extra KUGGIS sorting bin for projects/half-finished builds. The box (26x18x12 cm) that fits nicely in the SMÅGORA shelf unit is now our mini LEGO brick room . We like this simple but practical LEGO room. The hardest part was installing the drawer slides, but we picked the easy ones and it went well. The video below shows how the shelf pulls out from the bench.

{"title": "DIY Barbie Dream House: How to turn a Bookcase into a Doll House", "content": "The hype surrounding the may inspire you to create a Barbie Dream House for your child. (Or yourself, I understand that totally). This hack involves transforming an IKEA BILLY bookcase into a convertible Barbie doll house. By adding some paint, carpet, and a few pieces of furniture, you can create a custom and very pink doll house that oozes signature Barbie style. It’s a sweet home that can be used for endless storytelling and role-play. It’s a great way to repurpose old furniture and create a unique and personalized toy for your child. Incorporate as many play areas in this DIY dollhouse as you need and add another bookcase if you wish to further expand Barbie’s dream home. (Rooftop pool area with a slide?) If you don’t have an old bookcase ready for upcycling, search Facebook Marketplace for a pre-loved one. If you want to paint your dollhouse later on, it’s good to sand the different IKEA parts directly after unboxing. Take exact measurements. My measurements are calculated for a house according to the size of a BARBIE doll, as laid out in the plan above. If you want to build a house for toys with a different size, you might have to adjust your measurements. This is my vision for Barbie’s dreamhouse. You can adapt it to suit your style and how your kids play. If you keep the frame of the original bookcase untouched and build a roof on top instead, you can convert the when your child outgrows the Barbie phase. Reposition the anchor holes (8 mm and 5 mm) in the side walls 20 centimeters further down (respectively 19,8cm if you prefer to have some scope for putting in the dividing wall later on). Also, mark the depth of the holes on your drill. On one of your side walls mark a cut edge 13 centimeters further down, and when sawing keep the excess piece in order to construct the terrace of the house. Mark windows in the side walls as well as maybe a door in the dividing wall (= extra shelf) where and however you like them. Also, mark a cut edge on the backboard 20 centimeters further down. Don’t forget to mark a new dent on the backboard for fixing to the wall. If you want to put in the dividing wall on the second floor of Barbie’s house, it’s a good idea to move the new dent sideways. As you move the original top board further down to contain the construction of the shelf, one of the two middle shelf boards is going to be your convertible roof. Mark its cut edge at 69 cm, if you opt for a 13 cm terrace. Drill 2×4 new anchor holes (20cm respectively 19,8cm further down, 8mm and 5mm in diameter, mark the depth of the original holes on your drill). Saw the 13cm cut edge on one of your side walls, save the excess piece. Saw the 20cm cut edge and the new dent on your back wall. Shorten your new roof to 69cm by using the saw. Saw windows and doors wherever you like them. And last but not least, use the excess piece of your back wall to construct two lining disks for your saloon hinges as you are going to fixate them against the manual later on. Build the outer frame of the BILLY bookcase following the steps in the IKEA assembly manual. Take the 13cm excess piece of your shortened side wall and fix it in its corner as a floor plate for your new terrace. I used screws and glue, just to be sure. By the way, hot glue and a cutter knife are your best friends against all kinds of unwanted holes or gaps! Paint your row house as well as the middle board and the extra shelf in the desired colors. Better buy too much than too little paint, as you might have to touch up some scratches later on. First, clean up the surfaces with a damp cloth and let them dry. Then start with a , followed by the top coat of your choice. Naturally, we chose pink. Use self-adhesive foil to embellish the floor of your row house’s middle board. The foil also makes for easy clean-up. After having painted and pasted everything, build the middle board into the vertical middle of the row house according to the IKEA Manual. Use the 8th respectively the 10th (counting from the bottom) predrilled attachment holes in the side walls. If you rather not paint, you can use to cover up the walls for a chic modern design. Turn your extra shelf into a dividing wall by attaching it to your chosen framing horizontal boards. I predrilled holes and used screws to do so. You can make beautiful carpets out of IKEA table runners (GULLIRIS and MÄRIT in my case). I used glue to keep the cut edges from fraying. Use double-faced adhesive tape to attach your new carpets to your desired floors. The last step is the trickiest one, as you have to mount the saloon hinges to your higher side wall and your new roof board. This step is not found in the IKEA manual. In order to find the right angle best try out all constructing possibilities according to my pictures, then use the two lining disks you sawed out of the back wall’s excess piece to get the perfect fit for the saloon hinges. When the roof is in place, it creates a triangle space large enough for a loft bed. For more access, flip the roof over and play.

The door is pretty too with visible wood grains lined up in chevrons. Decide if you want the slats to be horizontal or vertical (I chose vertical for this one). Lay the doors out with their backs facing up. I attached them using the metal mending plates 3 on each side. Mark the screw holes through the mending plates using the pencil.  Drill the holes no more than 1/2 inch deep (use masking tape on your drill bit as your depth gauge). Connect the doors by screwing on the mending plates with the 1/2-inch screws.

So I would like to have a wardrobe suitable for his size, where he can easily see his clothes, make his choices, and actually access these choices by himself. It shouldn’t take up too much space, but having different dedicated spots for different items (e.g. socks vs. hats) would be great for keeping things organized. Something that can would be a plus. I’ve considered buying the SYVDE wardrobe (sharp corners and lack of flexibility in shelves). NORDKISA wardrobe (expensive and takes up more space than I’m prepared to set aside for clothes). Or alternatively / TROFAST shelves, before realizing that HUTTEN wine racks are a great fit for my needs. I was fortunate enough to find someone in my locality letting go of multiple used racks at a steeply discounted price. So the overall price I paid is far lower than any of the above options, too. (for a basic wardrobe unit with space to hang clothes): Assuming you are starting with 2nd hand / already-assembled racks: Use an appropriately sized allen key to remove all the screws from each rack. Separate the vertical pieces (shown in grey in the diagrams below) from the horizontal pieces (shown in multiple colours). Make sure the same wooden dowels used to secure the middle horizontal pieces remain attached to them, instead of the vertical pieces. If they are stuck onto the vertical pieces, use pliers to wriggle them loose. Reassemble rack 1 without the middle horizontal piece. Take the middle horizontal pieces from both racks, position them vertically over rack 1, and push down. You may need to hammer (gently) in order to have the pieces fit snugly. Reassemble rack 2 with the bottom horizontal piece only attached on one side of both vertical pieces. (Refer to diagram 2). Position rack 2 over the assembled parts and push down. Again, hammer (gently) if necessary. Attach a long dowel below rack 2’s top horizontal piece. I happened to have one with metal eyelets already drilled into both ends. So I hooked it up with two metal hooks, but if all you have is a plain stick, a piece of rope and some hot glue should do equally well. If you are starting with new and unassembled racks, skip steps 1-2 above. If you have more HUTTEN racks, you can stack them together (with one or two horizontal pieces removed), possibly in multiple stacks, to make wider wardrobes. I had 5 racks in total for my project. So I made two stacks and attached them to each other using zip ties for greater stability. I like the look of untreated wood, so I didn’t paint over the racks.

Adding more storage space will ensure everything has a place in your pantry and kitchen. Adding extra storage is key to crafting an organized kitchen that’s free of clutter. IKEA has many products to help you add more storage, including shelves, hooks, boxes, and see-through containers. It’s important to consider the storage capacity of different solutions and products to evaluate their suitability for your needs. For example, will a pantry drawer be large enough to store your spices, or do you need a dedicated shelf? Grouping similar pantry and kitchen essentials together will help you create a clutter-free kitchen where you can easily find what you’re looking for. The practice of grouping items is also the perfect time to get rid of items you’re no longer using in the kitchen (AKA clutter that’s taking up valuable storage space). You should prioritize organizational solutions and products that are easy for you to use. For example, pantry drawers are easy to use and let you simply pull the drawer open and pick the items you need to use. IKEA offers many storage systems.

Using every corner doesn’t mean buying as many storage products as possible; it means using your space efficiently to make finding supplies and ingredients as easy as possible. Here are 8 handy IKEA pantry organization tips and ideas using only IKEA storage solutions and products. First thing to consider if you’re designing a new kitchen — can you add this into your kitchen high cabinet? Or fit it into an existing cabinet? We love how the baskets inside the cabinet pull out automatically when you open the door. No need to dig through the pile to access items at the back. You can purchase IKEA’s affordable SÄVSTA memo board, a chalkboard that you can stick on the pantry wall or behind your pantry cabinet door. You can track everything from your shopping list to kitchen chores to meal plans. (If IKEA’s version doesn’t work for you, you can get similar .) You can use clear containers to visually track your groceries and ingredients. IKEA has a wide range of mason jars and tins for storing products like coffee, tea, sugar, cereals, flour, pasta, rice, and more. Our favorite is absolutely the and jars with bamboo lids. Using storage jars doesn’t just help you organize your pantry; it helps you save space wasted on bulky packaging while adding a personal touch to your kitchen. Shelves are a must-have when it comes to your pantry. And the and is your pantry’s best friend. The shelf insert will double your storage space. Another item that will help you make use of dead space is the . Insert it and effectively use the space above short items. One of the most useful storage system for the kitchen pantry are drawers. In order for drawers to function well (and not turn into a junk drawer) is to add in dividers or containers to keep similar items together. You can use any box for this. (A good way to upcycle old shoe boxes and cereal boxes.) We like the VARIERA boxes for this purpose as they are sturdy and can be easily lifted out of the drawer. Storage baskets are a fantastic addition to any kitchen. You can use baskets to organize clutter and group items together. For example a basket for “Breakfast” and in there, you’ll have your jams, cereal, nuts etc. Grab the basket or bin (if you have many items) and you’re ready for breakfast. You can even use different basket styles and labels to add a touch of your personal style to your pantry. Tania of used one of the most popular IKEA baskets, the (now in various sizes and designs), to group snacks and sauces in one place. You can use various hooks and clips from IKEA to store groceries on the inside of pantry cupboard doors. Clips can even be used to hang your grocery list or keep a notepad to track your weekly meal plans. There are plenty of great ways to customize your kitchen storage with hooks and clips. The Internet is full of tutorials and templates for jar labels. That’s nice and probably what makes an Instagram-worthy pantry. But if you don’t have time for that, pick up the IKEA 365+ label on your next IKEA trip. Each pack of 50 labels has a mix of two sizes. IKEA claims the stickers are easy to put on and take off without leaving marks. And if you use a non-permanent marker, you can rub off the text and use the label over and over again. Very useful when you do a refill and want to update the expiry date. For a more organized look, use the same pen color and write in a similar style (eg. all caps) on the labels. BILLY is good for books, crafts, shoes and yes, the pantry. As a pantry cabinet, the BILLY does it beautifully. BILLY’s shallow shelf means you’ll never forget anything deep inside the cabinet. Yet the shelf is deep enough for two or three rows of jars and cans. You can try to build it in, like or not, like . Either way it looks fabulous. Besides BILLY, other IKEA bookcases like the BAGGEBO and IVAR are popularly used as kitchen storage.

With customizable shelving, you can create the perfect pantry storage space for your needs, which can be further customized with other IKEA products like jars and tins.

For an affordable table, the LACK console table sells for less than $100 and carries the signature IKEA style. IMHO, it screams “Pick me up and .” Instead of a console table, you can use other pieces of furniture to dress up the entryway, such as a dresser, shoe cabinets like the or . A row of BILLY bookshelves, even a bench can do the trick. And of course, you can also do a little hack to turn a piece of IKEA furniture into a console table. Let’s take a look at 3 that did just that. I needed a desk that was long but slim enough for a hallway. The IKEA 15” depth and 57” width was perfect. My KALLAX shelf unit was already assembled. You can skip this step if buying new. Firstly, I dismantled the 2×4 KALLAX unit and took out all the inner shelves. I left the long top piece and two side pieces in tact. The plan is to use the long bottom piece to brace the top piece and the two side panels along the center. What I did was to drill holes large enough to secure the two side panels to the long bottom panel which is now used as a brace. I also used the original screws to lock the pieces all together. Lastly, I added the caster wheels to the bottom (optional). However, later I decided to remove the wheels. It made the desk too tall and the whole thing kept moving. The whole process took about an hour.  Cost wise, it was just the KALLAX shelving unit, though in my case I already had it. You can get a set of 4 caster wheels from Amazon for a under $20. The hardest part was the screwing. You have to make sure the holes you drill are deep and wide enough. ~ by Ramon Gil Our entryway narrowed down into the hallway, so a full sized console table would make it rather tight. I tried many ideas but finally decided to DIY a custom console table to fit our space. This IKEA hack is probably not for everyone but it demonstrates that you can make your furniture fit your space and not the other way round. It’s the perfect solution for us. This console table is made with 3 EKBY HEMNES Shelves (white) and 3 NIPEN table legs (gray). Two of the shelves were laid together and a part sawn off (see image below). If you don’t have the tapered space situation, you can leave the shelf as-is, in which case you may need another leg. The third shelf I used for the sides which I sawed also in the right size keeping it around 19 cm high, keeping the shelf width on one side and matching the other one with the part I sawed off. The shelves were then screwed together. Put three NIPEN legs under and your IKEA console table hack is done. (Alternative leg suggestion is the HILVER.) ~ Alda, Iceland I needed a narrow and long console table to fit our hallway. The console also needed to have a bit of storage for some of our shoes, a basket for our scarves, etc. So I went shopping at IKEA and came back with an idea and 2 LACK TV benches. First, I attached the tops of 2 LACK TV benches together using brackets underneath to create a long tabletop. I added 4 garden posts to make pretty legs and used 4 of the LACK legs doubled up to make a wide leg to support the centre. Then, I attached the original shelves to the lower part of the legs to hold boots, shoes and accessories. I covered the top in and added baskets to hold incoming mail and small items.

{"title": "DIY Loft Bed for Adults (Thanks for Those Bunk Beds, Kids!)", "content": ". We have a small apartment. We have a principle that every piece of furniture needs at least two functions. It’s a bed, storage, and reading corner. Besides, we also wanted a bedroom free of any clutter. So there’s just a bed in there. 1. Build the KURA beds as per IKEA instructions and rotate so that the slats are at the top. 2. Cut off the top part of the frame so that the KURA forms a rectangular cube. At this point it will be quite weak and wobbly. Ensure that that they can be supported by the wall. 3. Take the electric drill and 14 mm flat drill bit to drill about 2mm into all of the screw fittings holes where the KURA bed frames meet each other. They need to be flush (the screw heads stick out and prevent this otherwise). 4. To support the frame, I added two extra upright supports underneath each horizontal frame (so ten upright supports in total). I screwed them on with zinc brackets. The remaining wood from the top of the frame can be used for this. Note that the frame is not made from a single piece of wood (multiple pieces pieces glued together and the horizontal frame will bend under adult weight without the upright supports. Place the three beds together. I made the bed secure by wedging it in-between two walls using leftover wood. Brackets could also work if you have a solid brick wall. I then obtained the birch ply. 152 x 210 (in three pieces). There’s also some overhang between the frame and the side wall. This will depend on your circumstances and the width of your bed. I screwed the birch ply onto frame and then used zinc flat brackets to screw the birch ply together. I used some gorilla tape against the back wall to stop any potential forward wobble and to cushion the wood against the wall. It’s so secure though. For the shelving, I used the chest of drawers, they fit nicely. The central part is empty so that we can get in. One option would be to add doors to the frame (would probably require creating a column around the frame to give sufficient space for the hinges. We’ll probably cover with linen eventually. Overall, it feels very secure and it’s a nice height! The KURA beds were given away or thrown out. I only needed to pay for one (£20). The birch ply cost £200 (currently in short supply due to war in Ukraine) Osmo £30 Drill bit £10 Note that a carpenter quoted me £2500 + VAT for the same result. So it’s only 10% of that! In total, it took me about two weekends with a big wait to move the radiator and for the birch ply to arrive. I’m recycling wood and following by my principles. It’s hilarious that I’m using some – but they were being thrown away! It’s quite novel and it’s easy on the eyes. It doesn’t look like an . I sleep like a baby on that . There’s space for reading and a ton of storage. We had a in the way. So we had to move it first which delayed us by a month! The upright supports.

They are learning to choose (and throw everything out of a drawer). A toddler closet where they can access their clothes (or a selection of them) is a wonderful addition to your child’s room or nursery. These ideas for a toddler closet do not use regular IKEA kids wardrobes. Rather, IKEA storage units, toy storage frames and more are hacked into wardrobes for little ones. You can even repurpose an . The fun is in discovering what you can do with the IKEA furniture you may already have and turn them into something meaningful that grow with your child’s needs. Use the links below to jump to these specific toddler closet ideas: We decided our toddler no longer needed a nursery and that it would be great if he could choose his own clothes from his closet. So we purchased the new IKEA VIHALS storage unit. He doesn’t really need hanging space, so we decided to use some hooks on the side. In the open space, we ended up storing all his books. We also decided to personalize it a bit to suit our kid’s room decor. 1. First I assembled the VIHALS. It was fairly simple to do by myself, even with my 1,5-year-old sleeping in the next room. We didn’t use the handles that came with it. 2. Then I added a HACKÅS set of handles to the drawers. I ended up putting some extra duct tape and washer rings at the back, to give some extra support. Because of drilling the holes, the woodwork was a bit damaged. 3. One door I covered with some leftover piece of cork. 4. And at the side, I glued an old HAVERN hook rack. 5. Because we now did not have any handles on the doors, I used a leftover soft-closing/push-open underneath one of the shelves. And put a label of a hand on the door (still have to print a left hand though) so my toddler would know exactly where to push. This hack only took one trip to IKEA and an afternoon to assemble. I really like this simple, but personal hack and for now this is the perfect closet for him since he not yet needs a really big one. And in the future, the VIHALS can be easily used in a home office. ~ by Marleen K hacked a Montessori inspired children’s clothes wardrobe out of the IKEA TROFAST storage units.

{"title": "3D printing turns old IKEA legs into new table", "content": "3D printing may not be entirely mainstream just yet, but it sure has made strides in recent years … most surprisingly, IKEA for a recruitment campaign. Probably the tastiest job interview? Furthermore, cost of printing has also come down, with readily available for home use. Which prompted IKEA to launch the print-on-demand FLAMTRÄD range (only available in IKEA Germany.) I’ve also seen more and more 3D printed IKEA hacks including this fabulous . But what I’m most happy to see is how 3D printing offers new ways to construct and reconstruct IKEA furniture — giving them a new lease of life. Let’s look at how 3D printing salvages a set of old table legs and extends the life of the LACK table. We built this because we moved to a new house and we bought a second hand IKEA desk for very little money. However, we had no use for the legs in our setup and I found it wasteful to throw them away. We did however still need a coffee table, so I figured 1+1=2. The printing time is approximately 18 hours and without the legs it cost about 35 euros. (30 for the tabletop, 4 euro in printing material, and 1 euro for a couple of wood screws.) 4x IKEA GODVIN legs cut to 380mm (they seem to be discontinued but still available on second hand websites.) 50CM table top (I use 19mm multiply with HPL top and bottom layer) 1x M8 nut 1x M8x25 bolt Wood screws to mount the mounting plate to the table top. (You can use the ones that came with the legs depending on the thickness of your table top) 1x 3D printed leg brace/table mount 1x 3D printed spacer ring 4x 3D printed feet First, we printed the parts — feet for the legs to cover up the cut section. And a half-spherical base to attach the legs to the table top. I used a Prusa Mini to print the parts using PLA at 0.2mm layer height and 30% infill. After that, we disassembled the GODVIN legs from the mounting plate and cut the legs down to 38 cm using a saw for metal. Be careful not to cut off the threaded section as you’ll need it to screw into the base. Next, we pushed the 3D printed feet into the legs with a bit of force. Moving on to the 3D printed base, we inserted the M8x20 bolts which will later hold the legs in place. The next step is to insert the mounting plate that came with the GODVIN into the spacer ring. The M8 nut goes to the back of the mounting plate. Align mounting plate and spacer in the center of the tabletop. Screw mounting plate to the table top. Use M8 center bolt to attach the legs and base to the tabletop. And our 3D printed coffee table is done. I like the sleek ‘Scandinavian’ looking design (fits with the IKEA theme :)). My girlfriend thinks it looks like an UFO that sends beams to the ground. ~ by Niels If you want to shorten the legs of an IKEA LACK table, you might want to put an end-cap on the leg after you have sawed it off. The leg is hollow so it will need something to plug the hole and stabilize the leg.  This is a 3D printed end-cap that you can download and print on your 3D printer yourself. This end-cap is press-fit so you won’t have to glue it. Just Use (The) Force and push it in. The STL and STP files are available from . ~ by Borud The LACK table is one of the cheapest tables around and can be seen in many households. If you however find this table to be too short, then this nifty hack will be just the thing for you. 1 x 4 x 3D Printed LACK Table Feet ( ) 4 x O-rings (20mm inside diameter and 3 mm thickness) Print the files at a 3D Hub in your neighbourhood or on your own printer. ABS would be the preferred way to go for durability reasons. Just make sure that you do not hold back on the amount of infill (do not go under 20%) since your table legs should be holding quite some weight. If you want to take it to the next level you could change the height of the legs with this and match it to your taste. Once printed, nudge the O-rings and screw the table feet into place, but be gentle, the LACK table is not known for its structural integrity. ~ by Obijuan See more .", "author": "Jules Yap", "date": "2022-06-08T09:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://ikeahackers.net/2022/06/3d-printing-ikea-table.html", "categories": ["ikea-hacks"], "tags": ["ikea", "hack", "diy"], "image_url": "https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/3D-Printing-ikea-side-table-1.png", "excerpt": "3D printing may not be entirely mainstream just yet, but it sure has made strides in recent years … most surprisingly, IKEA for a recruitment campaign.

{"title": "The Ultimate Spherical Speakers Made from 4 Sets of IKEA Bowls", "content": "Research done by Dr. Harry Olsen (an early audio pioneer) in the late 1930s showed that spherical speaker enclosures were best for loudspeakers because they did not alter the frequency response of the installed driver as do other shapes of enclosures (rectangular, cylinders, pyramid shaped, etc.). He published a formal paper in 1951 in .  Here’s about his work: Many DIYers have built “full range” speakers using a single sphere from IKEA bowls. I set out to build a true full frequency spectrum 4-way speaker from IKEA bowls, using all three sizes, 5”, 8” and 11”. The speakers are shown below with two large spheres made from IKEA salad bowls: 11” bowls for a 6.5” subwoofer (down firing in the bottom sphere) and a 7” woofer (front firing on the next sphere). Then an 8” sphere for a 2” dome midrange driver and finally a 5” sphere for a 1” dome tweeter. The spherical speakers as part of a below. The bowls were used in their natural color and glued together using (which really holds well) and joined by an internal center 2” wood pole. Wood collars cut from ¾” pine board were made to separate the spheres and were stained to match. Holes were cut in the bowls to mount the speakers using a hand drill with appropriately-sized hole saws. The wiring runs internally up the pole and the crossover board is housed in the woofer sphere (second one up from bottom). The crossover is a three-way. The subwoofer is series wired into the crossover. It is a 2 Ohm driver combined with an 8 Ohm nominal crossover board that serves the other three drivers, making the system a nominal 10 Ohms. The speakers are mounted and glued to metal stands as shown that nicely fit the 11” bottom subwoofer sphere, with the subwoofer fitting inside the ring of the stand. The subwoofer is down firing. The speakers weigh about 30 lbs. each. The 6.5 inch subwoofer drivers are from Skar Audio and all the other drivers are Dayton Audio™ Reference Series with coated aluminum diaphragms – a 7” woofer with phase plug, a 2” dome midrange and 1” dome tweeter. The mid and tweeters feature for size efficiency and also have built in screens. The 3-way crossover is also from Dayton Audio™ (800Hz / 4,500Hz). The speakers were built using conventional work bench, hand tools, power drill, hole saws and a miter saw. Ten highlight photos are provide below with some description for each. Overall the speakers have excellent bass response (bass or kettle drums sound as if they are right in the room with you), and crisp, well-defined midranges and highs. Transient response is excellent with the aluminum diaphragms. The speakers create an open sound that makes them almost “disappear”. They cover 40 Hz to 20,000 Hz, have a nominal impedance of 10 Ohms, and have approx. 87b sensitivity at the standard 1 watt rating and measurement distance. They will fill your living room or family room with excellent fidelity and dynamic range, especially at the 90+ db level.  There is very little to no resonance relative to the deep base (see next section). Details of the design and construction are available by emailing me at stevekfisher@ , I have dozens on photos and several pages of step-by-step instructions including a list of all the parts you need and where to get them. You will have to commit serious time to this and the cost will be about $1,200 or so for the pair. But you will wind up with something very unique. Other drivers of similar size could be used instead of the ones chosen, as well as a different crossover board, that would be up to you. Don’t take my word for it though, visit these websites for some well respected manufacturers of spherical speakers … … and see some very high-end products that use spherical designs (there others too). These 10 photos are included here to highlight important steps but these are by no means comprehensive. Mark the center of the bowl for drilling the hole for the speaker driver (here the woofer). You can tape the bowl to a workbench at four places using Gorilla tape, so making a jig is unnecessary. Drill a ¼ inch pilot hole first then use the appropriate sized hole saw. Paint the inside of the bowls to be used for the subwoofers and woofers with a thick paint and cement mixture to in essence make the wood act like a lower resonance cement board. Then line the inside with rug underlay using Gorilla glue to adhere to the painted inside. Cut and fit a horizontal support board that will be pegged and glued on the inside top of the subwoofer sphere. This will serve as a support for the inner 2” wood pole that will support the other three spheres. Wood collars are cut (using hole saws) from 3/4” pine board, and are glued above and below the 2” pole hole to make a “channel” at the top of the subwoofer sphere that will locate and support the bottom of the support pole. The 2” support pole will be later glued in place. This photo shows the subwoofer sphere. The bottom will have the driver screwed in while the top will have the support pole coming through (the pole shown here is not full length, just shown for example). The center points for later drilling the 2” pole holes are located and marked. The various wires going to the drivers are soldered in place on the board (and coiled for later use). And the board is then glued to the inside rear of the woofer sphere. Later on, the 2” pole hole will be drilled when the bowl halves are glued together – the rear half containing the crossover and the front half the hole for the woofer driver. The spheres are glued together using Gorilla™ glue along the edge of the bowls, and by aligning and pressing the bowl halves together. Place a weight on top (as shown). While the glue is drying place four pieces of tape temporarily on the outside to maintain alignment. Note, Gorilla™ glue is strong enough to hold the bowls together even with the weight of the drivers. The support pole is glued onto the support board of the subwoofer sphere and through the collar “channel” at the top of the sphere. The pole must be well seated and the wires from the subwoofer are shown coming through the top of the sphere and will then go to the woofer sphere. An outer collar is also placed and glued that will sit between the subwoofer and woofer spheres. The subwoofer sphere and glued-in support pole is then placed on the three-legged speaker stand and the glued-together woofer sphere (with crossover board inside) is then slid onto the support pole and glued in place. The wires from the subwoofer are also threaded into the woofer sphere for joining to the crossover. This photo shows the wires from the crossover board for the midrange and tweeter spheres threaded through a channel groove cut into the support pole. After all spheres are glued into position and the speaker drivers installed, the stand will be positioned, aligned and glued in place onto the bottom of the subwoofer sphere. (This shows the subwoofer sphere only to illustrate). ~ by Steve Fisher Salad bowls are not only good for tossing greens, they make good spherical speakers too. Here’s a pair from Robert that are getting the kudos. He says, “I wanted to make a pair of speaker enclosures and bought a pair of IKEA BLANDA MATT, glued them together then mounted the speaker driver in them.” This is inspired by the most iconic speaker ever, the B&W Nautilus. The curved speakers were fashioned after the Nautilidae, a beautiful shelled creature. Damir Paco of Denmark used 3 IKEA BLANDA MATT wooden bowls and four BAREN hooks. The whole thing was assembled with vacuum tubes and fiberglass. He says, “They are real speakers. Unfortunately no instructions in how to make them because I did not think to take pictures while I made them.” “The bass is a little flat, but it can be done with a woofer. I have tried to solve it, to run the sound through pipes. The crossover is stored in the “large” bowl.” After seeing the possibility, we hope this inspires you to create your own version of the IKEA salad bowl speakers. ~ by Damir Paco, Denmark It is similar to this , with my own twist. The build is documented on but the basic steps are as follows: 1. Saw off the bottom of the BLANDA MATT bowls to fit the speaker according to the size of the round speaker. I used a Tang Band w4-657. ( ) 2. Make rings to lie between the bowls to ensure a good fit as not all the bowls are the same. 3. Glue two bowls together, sandwiching the ring, to form a ball or sphere. 4. Paint them (or not). I chose to spray paint them white to match my decor. First, I applied several coats of primer, then the spray paint and clearcoat at the end. Wet sand between each time varnish. 5. Place an O-ring around the ring to finish the joint neatly. 6. Drill holes for the terminals and drop in the Tang Band speaker. ~ by dmadsen", "author": "Jules Yap", "date": "2022-06-17T06:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://ikeahackers.net/2022/06/spherical-speakers-ikea-bowl-hack.html", "categories": ["ikea-hacks"], "tags": ["ikea", "hack", "diy"], "image_url": "https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/spherical-ball-speaker-diy.png", "excerpt": "Research done by Dr. Harry Olsen (an early audio pioneer) in the late 1930s showed that spherical speaker enclosures were best for loudspeakers because they did not alter the frequency response of the..."},
{"title": "Awesome French cleat tool storage wall hack", "content": "I’ve always wanted to make a French Cleat tool storage wall to house some of my tools, and the IKEA SANNAHED frame gave me the perfect basis to build it around. It turned out epic. I had a friend ask me to make one for them (already done!) and loads of positivity about it because of its space saving potential and functionality. Also as someone mentioned, at less than £200 for everything, it cost less than most ! 14 x IKEA SANNAHED frames (black) MDF 6 lengths of stripboard Foam inserts cut to the size of the frames Remove the backs of the IKEA frames and replace with MDF (cut to size) then pin them in place. This makes a tougher, more secure frame. Create the French cleat system by basically cutting equal and opposing 45 degree angles on the edge of pieces of strip wood.  We cut this free-hand with a . One length of the cut strip wood attaches to the wall (after finding the wall stud points) and the other is cut to the width of the frames and attached to each frame. One uncut length of strip wood is also used as a “spacer” to keep the frame equidistant from the wall at both it’s fixing point at the top, and at the bottom. Our configuration was for two rows of 7 frames each, so 14 frames in total, so we repeated the 45 degree angle batten and spacer batten layout for each row of frames. When mounting the frames to the French cleat bracket, as we had hand cut the strip wood, to get it to fit square we used a spirit level for fitting the first frame then squared the rest off against that. We got custom sized pieces of foam to fit into each frame — so 14 pieces of 34cm x 34cm x 5cm — which slotted snugly into each frame. First, we hand cut our company logo into one of the frames to act as a centrepiece by printing the logo on a piece of paper and cutting it out of the foam. We planned the layout of how we wanted our tools to be positioned on the wall. Finally we cut the tools into the foam using a scalpel to get a tight profile around every single item so the tool would fit snugly in without falling out when mounted on the wall. Then it was just a case of slotting all the frames onto the cleats. And the last step, slotting all the tools in place. are on our blog or watch the process video below. Less than £200 and it tool one person (me!) around 5 hours, start to finish. How neat it looks and how the French Cleat feature means I can remove the frames individually as needed for working with the contents. Planning the layout for the tools … I wanted symmetry so it looked cool on the wall but tools aren’t symmetrical so took some trial and error to get the layout right. Getting the frames level and square, I think we came up with a particularly cool “pivot” hack for that too (see video for more details!) Totally happy with the frames and how they’ve come out… might have taken more care with cutting in the 45-degree angles on the cleat to make it more consistent and therefore easier to get the mounts straight, but otherwise very happy. ~ by Jonathan This is a DIY project we recently did for our friends over at Brother’s Make. It was a tool storage wall we constructed from SANNAHED Picture Frames to store their measuring tools in a tiny slither of space in the corner of their workshop between large machines. Unlike our , it is a simpler IKEA hack. This version does not require adding wall cleats to the backs of the picture frames, but that also means you can’t switch the frames around or remove them from the wall. Nevertheless, the frames were perfect. They were sturdy, lightweight, and the exact width and depth needed to fit in the gap. The IKEA picture frames contain the foam insert rigidly and does not protrude uncomfortably. The tool storage wall allowed Matt to store a lot of tools safely and securely without taking up any floor space. Definitely a practical storage solution when you have lots of small hand tools. SANNAHED Picture Frames Shadow Foam Cutting Kit Wood off-Cut Table Saw Pliers Pins Screws 1. Take out IKEA frames from packaging and remove the back panel and picture mat. 2. Using pliers, remove the small metal clips from each frame. 3. Measure the size of each frame on plywood, mark with a pencil and cut those shapes out with your table saw. 4. Attach the wooden plywood pieces to the back of each picture frame with brad nails. 5. Using the frames as a template, cut out a correctly sized piece of Shadow Foam. Insert the foam to the frame. 6. Create a layout for your tools in the frames. Take a photo for reference. 7. Using the scalpel from the cutting kit, cut around each tool perfectly, going over the outlines to ensure a deep and thorough cut. 8. Using your fingers and thumbs, pull the foam out of the cut shapes. Insert tools into new space. 9. Screw the finished tool frames into the space available in your workshop. Alternatively you can fasten the frames to wall studs. 3 hours and about 80 quid. How is maximises the space used in the workshop. Coming up with the best layout to get all the tools in place.

The good news is it’s not hard to DIY a wooden keyboard stand. For that matter, a sturdy one. Or even a fancy . Here’s are two piano stands that are the easiest to make. All you need are some basic woodworking skills and a store that will cut wood pieces for you. And you’re set. I wanted to have a keyboard stand that was the same color as the rest of the furniture. After our little IKEA hack, it visually fits into our room. BESTÅ 60x20x64 cm frame ( ) Oak planks 80x6x2 cm 4 wood screws Saw Cordless screwdriver Complete the frame but without the back and one side panel. (The bottom of the frame has holes, so I have faced this side to the corner.) Turn the frame 90° so the original bottom and top (which are thicker) now form the legs of the keyboard stand. The one original side panel (that’s the thinner panel) is now the top piece. Fix the spare side panel to the back of the frame using the original mounting method. (Make small holes for the original metal dowels. Drill pilot holes on the inner side of legs and screw them in. Then use those original plastic cam locks to lock them in place.) Now that the top is done, cut the wood planks (oak in my case, to match the color of my other furniture) into two halves. Drill holes into the planks and fix them on the underside of the BESTÅ frame using the 4 screws. Flip it back up and place your digital piano on the stand. And play! It was a very affordable project, considering the price of wooden keyboard stands . Our DIY project came up to 37 EUR (BESTÅ 28 EUR and wood planks 8 EUR + screws 1 EUR). Measuring the holes for metal screw dowels accurately. I didn’t use any finish or stain on the wooden planks (feet), so I had to keep them clean during the process. “I played the piano yesterday, why do I have to play today? (my 8yo daughter)” 🙂 ~ by Mirek I wanted a nice stand for my Yamaha 88-key electronic piano. Commercial ones are expensive at around $150. So I built one for about $26, using two inexpensive $6.99 FABIAN wall shelves from IKEA as the basis for the design. 2 FABIAN wall shelves and pine strips Woodscrews The pictures show the construction. The two FABIAN shelves become the vertical side pieces of the piano stand. The two pine strips (I used Claymark Select Pine strips from to minimize additional work) were cut to the proper length for my keyboard (49.75 inches). The pine strips space the FABIAN shelves apart at the proper distance so that the keyboard can sit on the top ends of the FABIAN shelves. The FABIAN shelves each come with two nicely silver-finished right-angle metal brackets. These are intended to hang the shelf from the wall. But as you can see in the photos, I used these brackets to square up and stiffen the piano stand instead. They do the job perfectly, and make a nice light, strong structure. ( The FABIAN is discontinued. You can use these for the same effect. You can also use current wall shelves from IKEA such as the in walnut. However they are slightly longer at 31 1/2 inches. This will affect the final height of the piano stand. Use a circular saw to cut it down to the right height for you and your keyboard. The easiest method though is to buy lumber from Home Depot since you’re already getting the pine strips. Get them to cut two pieces of wood similar to size of the FABIAN wall shelf – 70 x 24cm or 28 x 9 inches and assemble them in the process above.) Now attach a and it’s perfect. ~ by Gnobuddy", "author": "Jules Yap", "date": "2022-07-12T06:30:00-04:00", "url": "https://ikeahackers.net/2022/07/wooden-keyboard-stand.html", "categories": ["ikea-hacks"], "tags": ["ikea", "hack", "diy"], "image_url": "https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/wooden-keyboard-stand-ikea-1a.jpg", "excerpt": "If you’ve got yourself a piano keyboard, pairing it with a good stand is essential.

{"title": "Kids Dress Up Clothes Storage: 3 ways to hack it", "content": "Kids love to play dress up and live it up as their favourite characters or superheroes. That’s the fun bit. Finding functional storage for these fabulous dress up costumes and accessories — not quite so fun. Which usually leads to an . Thankfully, making a dress up storage wardrobe is not that hard to do. We show you 3 ways to hack one — from a beautiful glass door closet to a theatre style dress up station. You pick! If you’ve got young kids you know how much they like to dress up. I’ve got 2 girls who think they’re royal princesses one day and doctors the next. Seeing them play dress up at preschool was always fun and we had a couple pieces at home but not much. I decided for the holidays we’d gift them a complete dress up closet. Looking online I was really disappointed in what was available — they were cute but not functional! I knew whatever we got had to close up, when you’ve got kids, being able to contain a mess is important; that’s why bins, cubbies and storage boxes are so common with kid storage, but everything I saw was open. The next issue was they were so small that there was no way the closet would hold more than a few dresses, let alone full length dresses for my tall kid. Lastly only a handful had storage for accessories, and none had storage on top of the unit because most were A frame styles. We don’t have a lot of play space and losing extra floor space wasn’t an option. I sketched out what I wanted and began searching, eventually I came across the HAUGA bookcase and realized how perfect this would be. The bypass doors not only contain the mess but keep them from pulling EVERYTHING out at once. Curtain rod Curtain rod hanger Children’s and (recommend velvet, since most dress up clothes are synthetic fabrics and the velvet makes them stay on the hangers better) Coordinating cabinet knobs (consider size due to bypass doors) Bin for storage Mainstays Collapsible Fabric Cube Storage Bin (10.5″ x 10.5″) fit perfectly (we already had these) Assemble the HAUGA per IKEA directions If using peel and stick wallpaper, I recommend placing it BEFORE you slide the backboard in. My peel n stick wallpaper was almost the perfect size for the half-panel, so I adhered it aligned down the centerline, then trimmed the excess off (this is important otherwise it will pull off when sliding in). Other options would be to paint the backboard or character fabric or curtain to the back! Instead of installing the shelves on both sides, only install on one side, we used all the shelves except one. Our shelves hold hats, shoes, costume jewelry (thrift store!), headbands, a box of tutus and whatever else they shove in there! On the other side grab a hanger and mark where the center of the curtain rod will go, make sure you have enough room for the doors to close. It’s a close fit but the Amazon hangers I used worked, even with the rear slider door being on the hanger side. I’d recommend the curtain rod go on the side where the sliding door is in front of the other. (Not what I did, I do intend to eventually reverse the doors) After marking the spot, install the curtain rod. Replace knobs with your own. Fill with dress up goodies and enjoy the dress up show! I like how everything is contained when they’ve cleaned everything up. My daughter loves that we customized it with princess wallpaper and she just picked out some new rose shaped knobs for it. I had some concern about the glass doors but after a few months it has not been an issue. Eventually we will add a mirror to the side and we’re looking for cute hooks so they can have quicker access to their favorite items. ~ by Claire DeCamp I created a dress-up wardrobe closet for my 3 yr old daughter from what I think is a discontinued TROGEN chest of drawers. I bought it from the “As-Is” section of the IKEA store. TROGEN dresser/ changing table Brush & white semi-gloss paint Sand paper Decorative contact paper Decorative baskets From the original piece I removed the drawers and the sliders. Then, sanded the furniture and painted it with white semi-gloss. (Or you can leave it in its original blue.) After drying I lined the inside of the main wardrobe area and the back of the cubby area with decorative contact paper. I could’ve used wall paper too but wall paper cost more. Lastly, I attached the short tension rod (short shower curtain rod) I found from a dollar store, on the main part of the wardrobe. Placed the decorative baskets on the cubby and voilà! A dress-up wardrobe closet. ~ by Jule Brown, Torrance, CA I googled and googled dress up stations for my 2 little girls but couldn’t find anything that was even remotely affordable. So I came up with a plan to do an IKEA hack. It turned out super simple. Shelf (or other curtain/ fabric of your choice) I bought one IKEA LACK shelf and we then turned it upside down. We mounted a simple curtain rod to the bottom of it. On an empty wall in the playroom we mounted a 2 x 4 on the wall for extra support. We used screws to secure the LACK hardware on the 2 x 4 and and slotted the LACK shelf on to the hardware. Then mounted the LACK shelf to the wall, anchoring into studs. (You may not need to do this step, depending on your wall.) The next part was the way I did it but it can be done several ways. I added a second small curtain rod from Home Depot, the kind that can easily be taken on and off. Then, I chopped up the FABLER BARD curtain from IKEA. I sewed up part of it to hang from the curtain rod and the other parts of it, I staple gunned to the outside to cover up the sides. I then used the tie backs to make it look more like a theatre/closet dress up station. A little touch of some decorations, FABLER mirror, MINNEN trunk toy box, and some FABLER wall hooks and there you have it … an instant kid’s dress up station for my little girls’ princess dresses and outfits. I think the whole hack came in less than a $100. That includes some extra fabric for window treatments and a princess tent!

Since this was a second residence for us, we had to purchase most of the furniture. We, of course, , but then we fell in love with an entertainment center (not IKEA) with slate accents. So I set out to make the pieces we purchased from IKEA match! VITTSJÖ laptop table The TRULSTORP is a rectangular coffee table from IKEA that offers a smart solution to the neverending need for work surfaces and storage. Dimensions are 45 1/4 x 27 1/2″. The clever thing about the TRULSTORP coffee table is the divided table top, making it a very functional piece of furniture. You can pull one of the table top halves towards you via the built in lift mechanism. The extended table top lets you work or eat from your sofa without the need to bend over. Under the table top, a practical storage space for books, magazines, remotes, and other small objects. The fixed table top means you can still place coffee table accessories and decor without the need to remove them every time you need the lift top. As for durability, it’s made from chipboard so it will need the usual care for such material. Such as wiping clean with a damp cloth, then wiping the surface dry with a clean cloth. For the moving parts, do check regularly that all assembly fastenings are properly tightened and retighten when necessary. In IKEA US, it sells for $129.99. Local store prices may differ. Brad nailer Gorilla glue Drill Stain Tile nippers I started with the TRULSTORP coffee table in white. I really liked this table because it is sturdy and we work from home (or apartment :)) so this offered an additional workspace. I assembled the table but did not attach the liftable surface. I glued and then used a brad nailer to secure the sides of the table surface to frame it. Next, I used a to try to match the grey stain on the entertainment center. The polystain seals and stains in one step, and I used only one coat, which leaves streaks of white show through, looking like wood grain! Then I used to fill in the rest of the table top, taking care to match the thicknesses so that the surface is as level as possible. (No spilled cocktails!) You can only purchase a case online, but my local Home Depot had them in an individual sheet, for $3.99 ea. I used about 10- 15 sheets. Once I finished tiling the table, I grouted it with black non-sanded grout that I had on hand. Once we received the entertainment center, I quickly realized the stains did not match. The entertainment center had much more of a brown undertone, so I restained the table right over the grey! Here is the finished slate coffee table. I also purchased the VITTSJÖ laptop stand to make a side table. I removed the glass and purchased a that I cut to size for the base to the tabletop.

{"title": "We made a Built-In Media Cabinet from stock BESTÅ units", "content": "We recently hacked two BESTÅ cabinets to make a beautiful built-in media cabinet. We decided to hack the BESTÅ because it has good “bulk” to it and makes for a nice built-in look. was also considered but we thought they were not deep enough and felt it would have required more trim to make it look hearty. Let’s start with the end — this is our built-in media cabinet after the hack. We had a 114 inch width/media nook to build into. First, we began by simply putting the BESTÅ units together. As you can see in the photos, we used the feet included with the cabinet, because it allowed our media cabinet to have some height and we did not have to build a platform. We used the brackets and feet provided with the BESTÅ storage units to connect the two cabinets together. We also cut a sizable hole in one of the cabinets to run plugs to the outlet in the wall behind the cabinet. The hole is in a cabinet we knew would have a door on it, so it does not show. And, as you can see in the photos, we added plug-in wall sconces so we knew we’d need to run the wires to a plug and power strip we store inside the bottom of the BESTÅ unit. We decided to prime the cabinets after they were assembled. It took two coats, and we did a light sand between the coats of primer, but we did not sand before putting the paint on. In hindsight, we probably should have primed everything before it was assembled, but we had limited space to lay all of the pieces out to dry. is not great when it gets on floors or other furniture, so we had to work hard to be tidy.  It’s also really smelly, so do this outside or in a well ventilated room. We opened a lot of windows and it was 20 degrees outside. Yikes! Ultimately, it all turned out okay. After primer, we purchased the two spruce slabs for the and had it cut at Lowe’s (free of charge) to the dimensions we needed: 56.5 inches x 20 inches. We scoured the internet for countertops and prefab options and everything just came up short for what we need in this space. But, ultimately, you could buy a prefab countertop at a big box store or IKEA and cut it to your needs or even have a top made (if it’s in your budget). We screwed the two countertops into the BESTÅ, from the underside up. There was a slight seam where the two tops meet. This required caulking, sanding and repainting to blend the seam. There is a 1.5 inch overhang on the wood top in the front, and about 5 inch overhang in the back. So, while the countertop is one inch from the wall, the cabinet below is about 6 inches from the wall. We did this so the cabinet would not be so deep into the nook, but if you’re doing this on a regular wall… you could make the adjustments. Also, we needed to make sure we could get a hand to electrical parts and cables behind the shelves, if we ever needed to. Once the countertops were in place, sanded, and primed. We used the IKEA wall mounting brackets to mount the entire piece to the wall. We connected the brackets underneath the back of the countertop. Even though the piece would ultimately be mounted when all of the finishing work was complete, we wanted to make sure there were no shifts after we measured open spaces we needed to fill in. Next, we cut the wainscotting to fit the spaces on the sides of the storage unit. We just used a jigsaw with a fine blade!  Really… We knew the edges would be covered, so we weren’t super worried about smooth clean cuts. This is key. To mount the wainscotting, we built a frame inside the open space. We placed/mounted the 1×2 boards in the edges of the open space. So, we mounted a 6 inch board underneath the countertop, a 12 inch board on the wall, and 12 inch board on the cabinet. We recessed the framing boards about 1/4 inch in, so the wainscotting would look flush. We used the brad nailer around the edges of the wainscotting to connect them to the framed area. It’s okay if there are tiny gaps between the wainscotting and the wall or the BESTÅ unit.  Our mantra through this whole project was “that’s what caulk is for!” After the wainscotting was on, we installed the 5 inch baseboard. The base boards go just below the doors (so they can still close) and over the front of the bottom of the wainscotting. We have other ornate baseboards already in the house that are too tall for this project, so we chose the very plain 5 inch flat baseboards from Lowe’s for this cabinet, so they would not stand out. After we brad nailed the baseboard to the legs of the BESTÅ, we trimmed out the entire piece. We used the 1.5 inch flat trim around the tops, and edges of the countertop. However, we left “openings in the top, because we needed to run the wiring for the speaker to the plug below. We used quarter-round trim where the wainscotting and the wall meet and to close the small gap between the baseboard and the floor. A simple did the trick (less than $20 on Amazon or at a home improvement store), so we didn’t use fancy or expensive saws to do the trim. The miter box was great at helping to cut the angles, and the brad nailer was enough for this project, but it would have been easier if we had a nail gun so we could have used longer finishing nails. Once the trim was complete, we used a in white to seal all of the gaps.  Make sure to smooth the caulk, because if you can see it when it dries, you will see it under the paint. We had to do a lot of sanding in areas where caulk became clumpy. We also caulked the small gap between the BESTÅ and flush wainscotting. Once the caulk has about a day to dry, you should apply the BESTÅ overlays from . We simply used wood glue to attach them to the doors. But, take the doors off to do the overlays. It’s too tricky otherwise. Finally, we put the doors back on and painted. As you can see, we only kept the BESTÅ doors on in the middle of the cabinet for closed storage, and left the doors off on the sides to have open bookshelves. We simply used a little caulk and paint to cover the bookshelf leveling holes on the open shelving area. (Now, I should state here that we did not follow such a smart painting plan (as indicated in the photos). We had to wait longer than expected for the overlays (I should have paid attention to production times), and I am impatient. So, we painted a lot before the overlays arrived.) It took 4 coats of semi-gloss Sherwin-Williams “Repose Gray” to cover this project. So, that was half the gallon. We did not sand before or between coats, unless there was an area where it was uneven and seemed to need it. We have not added a top coat yet, and we will. The paint may chip a little if you place anything sharp or heavy on the BESTÅ shelves. So, that’s our next plan… clear topcoat. It took us about one month to finish this. To be fair, we did not work on it everyday – just on the weekends. And, painting is really what takes the longest. The entire process from start to finish (including about 10 trips to the hardware store), it took us about 25 working hours. The project cost us just less than $950. The BESTÅ and the two spruce slabs for the countertop were the most expensive purchases, of course. The slabs were $125/piece ($250 total). We also had to purchase an $80 brad nailer (which I’m including in this cost). I truly cannot believe how high end it looks. It’s beautiful. We had received quotes to do this project from contractors with all wood, and it was about $3000 – $4,0000 in materials and labor. So, we saved a decent amount of money. Measurements!!! And, second guessing ourselves. We just weren’t that confident going into it, but we did it! Make sure the entire unit is primered with Zinsser. If you miss a spot on the BESTÅ, the paint won’t stick. And seriously… measure twice. Measure three times! Also, I hate to admit this, but I bought and used the wrong caulk (non-paintable) the first time around and had to pull all of it off after it dried, and then recaulk. It was a costly mistake, because primer really will NOT adhere to non-paintable caulk. ~ by Tuesdi Dyer (Instagram)", "author": "Jules Yap", "date": "2022-03-07T09:00:00-05:00", "url": "https://ikeahackers.net/2022/03/built-in-media-cabinet-besta-hack.html", "categories": ["ikea-hacks"], "tags": ["ikea", "hack", "diy"], "image_url": "https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FINAL-ikea-besta-built-in-media-cabinet-768x576.jpg", "excerpt": "We recently hacked two BESTÅ cabinets to make a beautiful built-in media cabinet.

{"title": "Sliding Bookcase Doors KALLAX hack to divide your rooms", "content": "I replaced single-glazed sliding doors that divided the sitting room and dining room with a sliding bookcase. For one “door”, I used two 2×2 cubes and one 2×1 unit. As we already owned 4 separate 2×2 cubes and they seemed to be exactly the same width as the internal doors, we thought it might be possible to stack them. With one additional 2×1 KALLAX they almost matched the height of the internal doors. First, still a work in progress but let us show you how it looks from the dining room, when the units are pushed together to close up the doorway. And the units pushed apart to enter the living room. We can access the storage cubes from both sides — from the dining or living room — which is so very useful.

I still need to buy some battens about 40-40mm by 10mm to make an L shaped shroud to hide the rail. Unladen the sliding bookcase doors move quite easily on carpet but as can be seen on the photo, the carpet is hideous. We replaced it with a wood laminate floor. And it rolls without issue.

I placed these halfway into a cube and taped them in place. This lets enough light through and is sturdy enough to prevent books being pushed through.

{"title": "The best Christmas Tree when you live in a small space", "content": "Merry Christmas! Elly shows us how she turned the IKEA Christmas tree fabric into a 3D wall hanging, complete with presents. She bought this wonderful IKEA christmas tree fabric over a year ago. It’s available in some IKEA stores listed as VINTER pre-cut fabric. The initial plan was to make a curtain but the fabric was too long. It would have been a shame to cut it. Then she got a new much better idea: A 3D wall hanging. This fabric tree is huge and needs a lot of space on the wall! Including the fabric above the tree and under it, it’s more than 2 yards long and over 1.5yard in width. Let’s see how it looked at first, without any decorations. The tree looks real enough. But maybe not Christmassy enough. The first thing Elly made were the christmas packages. She used a range of fabrics with Christmas colours for each of the packages.

Cause no one wants to bump into bed corners. IKEA shelf Slim (when can be directly connected to 220V) A small circular switch (able to handle 220V) Some cable and connectors First, use the LED downlight to trace out the circle on the LACK shelf. The diameter of the circle should be slightly smaller than the downlight. This now becomes the underside. (Please check that the slim end of the mounting bracket is pointing up.) Using a , carefully cut out the circle on the LACK shelf. It will take a bit of force and you may need to score the top repeatedly to cut through. Don’t worry if you don’t get perfectly nice edges as the LED downlight will seal up the edges (which is why the circle should be smaller than the downlight). Pop out the cut circle and you’ll see the paper honeycomb structure within the LACK shelf. You need to create enough space for the downlight hardware so remove as much material as necessary. Next make a hole for the switch to go through. Wire up the light with cables and connectors. The cable should come out through the back of the LACK shelf. (If you’re unfamiliar with electrical wiring, please consult an electrician.) Drill holes in your wall and install screws to hold up the floating shelf mounting brackets. Depending on your wall, you may need to locate wall studs and use wall plugs. Follow IKEA instructions for this part. Lastly, wire up the light and hang the shelf in place. Flip the switch and let there be light! Choose a yellow light for the LED lamp to create a cozy atmosphere to wind down at the end of a long day. White light is too harsh and glaring.

{"title": "Dream IKEA kitchen just in time for the Big Day", "content": "In August 2018 we got married. Everything was arranged: DJ, location, catering. But 6 weeks before the date, due to circumstances, we had to switch to having the wedding at home. In our home, we had a 20 year old kitchen. The one condition my wife laid down was a new kitchen. At first, I designed a custom made kitchen, but due to time constraints, that was no longer possible. In Belgium, kitchen companies are closed for 3 weeks in July, so that wasn’t an option. At that time I was working as a project manager with a joinery company, but that also wasn’t possible because there was no time for production, ordering wood, etc. So the only possibility was IKEA which had cabinets in stock. I redesigned my into standard elements of 40-60-80cm width so they would fit in my floor plan. To reach the required height I didn’t use the standard IKEA PVC legs. Rather I at 2, 8 and 10cm high. The same day we bought the cabinets, we had them delivered to our home. By evening I started assembling all 25 cabinets and by 5AM in the morning they were ready. Not installed yet of course, because there was an extra challenge. Our former kitchen was still in use and not demolished yet. So at the same time I was doing the demo, I was installing the new kitchen. You see this in photo. We switched the position of the kitchen. The dining room became kitchen and vice versa. So all plumbing and electricity had to be adapted as well. We didn’t like the standard VEDDINGE melamine fronts. But I did buy one model per size so I had the drilling distances for the hinges. I made new oak veneer fronts, but some had to be adapted as well. The ones from the lower cabinets against the wall were extended in both directions. So they start from 2cm above the floor and pass 3cm. So we could work with a handleless gutter that does not exist on the IKEA range. Veneer fronts Brass sink and tap Black door handles Miele downdraft hood ATAG oven black Reginox miami copper sink and tap Black solid HPL worktop Attach an OSB or plywood 18mm on floor. Use Tech7. Put the cabinets on top and fix them to the OSB with screws. Install on top of the cabinet a wooden frame against which you attach a 50mm metal C-profile. Extend the doors 20mm above so you still have a gap of 30mm to open the door. Cabinets €2800 – 3 weeks Veneer €1400 – 2 weeks Appliances €5000 Paint €300 – 2days Worktop €800 -3 days It is not visible that the cabinets are from IKEA Making the fronts and creating a custom made look with standard elements. Exact position of the hinges in the fronts It took a lot of effort in a short time, but it was my time which I didn’t have to pay. The fulfillment of it is still every day visible. So I wouldn’t have done it differently The hood is a downdraft model, so in the cabinet are tubes of 220*80. A lot of available space is gone. In this cabinet we have drawers from a cabinet that is less deep. In the dining area we have a seating bench made out of METOD wall cabinets, put on the floor. On top an oak worktop and then a measure made cushion. The island worktop is 3440mm L made out of mat trespa, because it was the only available material in this length. A lot of cabinets have cut outs to allow for piping and electricity. Side panels and fillers are custom made. Everything was painted on site. Black fronts with oil RAL 9005.

{"title": "7 Clever & Easy IKEA FLISAT Table Hacks for more Fun & Play", "content": "The IKEA FLISAT children’s table is a pretty clever little thing. Featuring removable white covers and integrated TROFAST tubs, it easily transforms between a desk and sensory table setup. Open the covers, and you’ll fit 2 TROFAST storage tubs snugly under the top of the table. Your child can reach in and get their supplies, e.g., LEGOs, and build on the desk. And when they’re done, sweep everything into the bin to clean up. Or at least that’s what we all hope the kiddo does. It easily converts for sensory play for toddlers or even older kids. Instagram is full of ideas on what to add to those tubs to maximize them. Think of filling them with an array of tactile materials like rice, pasta, chickpeas, or sand to engage young hands in exploring different textures. Add water for even more sensory exploration and imaginative play scenarios. Read on to see how to make the versatile kids’ table set work harder for much more fun. Kelly added an to the FLISAT desk for versatile tabletop storage and organization. It’s a fantastic idea if you don’t have space for a wall-mounted pegboard. The main items you’ll need, besides the FLISAT table, are the IKEA SKÅDIS Pegboard and SKÅDIS Connectors. All you need to do is attach the connectors to the bottom of the SKÅDIS Pegboard, sandwiching the pegboard between the metal brackets. Make sure they are screwed in tightly so the pegboard is well supported. Then, screw the connectors to the edge of your FLISAT table. This will securely mount the pegboard to the table. Lastly, add any SKÅDIS accessories you like directly onto the pegboard using the peg holes. You can add hooks, shelves, bins, and more. Arrange them however you like to suit your kid’s storage needs. Lauren has a straightforward yet practical hack to turn the FLISAT table for kids into a play table with more storage and better organization. Assemble the IKEA FLISAT table if you are buying a new one. Attach two 8mm pine wood brackets (using screws or nails) to one side of the table. Line these up to the joint in the table—pre-drill to prevent splitting. Next, screw one length of 40mm x 19mm pine wood (cut to 445mm) onto the brackets and slide on your containers! Your table is a play station or storage unit for craft materials, LEGO, etc. We know how light can enhance playtime. It’s also educational. Conventional lightboxes don’t come cheap. But if you have a FLISAT table, it’s not all that hard to make one. Just make sure to get to control brightness. Harsh lights can hurt little eyes. You’ll need an acrylic sheet cut to the size of the tabletop. Use a for an opaque finish. Drill a hole on one end of the TROFAST bin. Thread the LED strip light through the hole and glue it along the four inner sides of the TROFAST bin. Drop the bin back in place, cover it with the acrylic sheet, and boom! Lightbox. See the full tutorial on . shows us how to add an art paper roll onto the FLISAT, turning it into an art table, and it’s so easy. Screw onto the two side legs of the FLISAT. Thread the paper roll onto a wooden dowel rod and drop it onto the hooks. Done! It’s a new play every day. Load the table with different elements, and the wonders will never cease. I’m amazed at Kendra’s ideas, as they show the versatility of the IKEA FLISAT table as a sensory table. That is a . Add a into the TROFAST bin, and your kid will have hours of splish-splashing fun. All you need to do is drop the sink into the TROFAST bin, which sits snugly in it, to avoid any toppling over, mess, and spills. Chalkboard on one side and on the other. Get a roll of adhesive chalkboard film and stick it onto the tabletop for the chalkboard. Smooth out bubbles, if any, and trim excess film from the sides. On the other side, lay the LEGO baseplates centered on the tabletop. Cut the baseplates to fit inside the grooves of the TROFAST bin. Stick them onto the tabletop with double-sided mounting tape. How have you hacked the IKEA sensory table? ! The FLISAT kids table from IKEA has quickly become one of their best-selling items. With such high demand, this versatile kids’ desk is often out of stock. Waiting for a restock can feel like an eternity when you have preschoolers eager to sink their hands into the mound of play sand.

He loves playing with rice, sand, and pasta but has never had an organized play space for sensory activities until now. This IKEA hack is best for dry-play items. 1. She sawed off the two back legs and cut one-third of the table top off so it can attach to the wall (you don’t have to do this part, but her kid’s playroom was getting overcrowded, so she reduced the size of the table and mounted the back of the table to the wall.) 2. She then sawed two rectangular squares on the table. 3. Secured two plastic buckets with screws and hot glue in the holes. 4. Lastly, painted and sealed it with . The creative minds over at came up with an ingenious way to repurpose the IKEA TROFAST storage unit as a temporary sensory table solution. They placed the TROFAST shelving facing up and discovered that the removable bins dropped perfectly into place. This allows the TROFAST to work double-duty as both a storage unit and sensory play set, and it’s also a budget-friendly option for those who already own the unit. With some quick thinking, the versatile TROFAST can be adapted to enrich a child’s learning even more. As if the TROFAST sensory table hack couldn’t get any better, @mabelsplayroom discovered the TROFAST storage bins are the perfect size to nest inside the KNAGGLIG crates. This lower table height makes it ideal for sensory play with young toddlers. The affordable price point means any parent’s budget can accommodate this simple, practical setup. We love that the modular design allows for quick and easy clean-up when playtime is over, simply by removing the bins and crates from the play areas. Between sessions, the stackable crates stow away neatly until the next time.

{"title": "This crib is made for less bending over, more ventilation", "content": "The that was used when my son was an infant (1999) was stored away after he’d outgrown it. Some of those crib parts were unfortunately misplaced during a move. Anyway, the mother of my second child has a back problem, and she asked me to make a crib which would require that she bend over less often. AND she wanted the crib to be very well ventilated. So, the Trampoline Crib was invented in March 2021 before the birth of our daughter. The PLUS was to make it an IKEA hack using some parts from my son’s IKEA crib from 1999. (Yes, my son and daughter were born 22 years apart.) First, one must locate the various IKEA parts listed above. There are places online to find pre-owned IKEA furniture; I often pick-up at low cost items that are no longer wanted on FB Market for example. Often, folks are moving out of town, and will sell at a very reasonable price because they intend to purchase and assemble all-new IKEA furniture for their next home. Measure the height of the three walls to be whatever you desire. This may require  some “trial and error”. We chose 16″ as that was comfortable for our arms to reach down and lift/lower our infant from/to the hammock mesh. The length of each of the three walls simply corresponds with the dimensions of our plywood base. For our bedroom, the best shape was 24″ wide by 36″ long. (If you need exact measurements, I will send them, but the point is that it was built for a rather small bedroom.) With basic tools like a hand saw and power drill the bookcase walls were re-formed into 3 of the 4 walls of The Trampoline Crib. For The Trampoline Crib’s fourth “wall” we simply used the vertical bars found on the . We decided to NOT affix this wall of bars permanently. We can lift it off, and set it aside; when it’s time for the baby to sleep, we lower this fourth wall of vertical bars in place. Because it is removable, it is easier to change sheets and clean the crib, etc, etc. Also, we don’t have to lift the baby much; we can place her onto the trampoline, and then place the vertical bars in place. The original crib was longer, so we cut-off the excess length of the vertical bars. Gravity holds the wall of vertical bars in place, and we latch it in place, so our infant cannot kick it away; the latch is simply a piece of wood that can be spun on a center screw to create tension. It’s all very simple and snug. Once we decided on the desired height of our Trampoline Crib; we were pleased to discover that the length of the four desk legs was perfect for the height of our Trampoline Crib. So, we did not cut the length of the legs of the crib; we simply mounted the four legs onto the plywood base using nuts-and-bolts. We may decide as our infant grows that we will cut the legs shorter; this will simply mean measuring the same distance from the bottom of each leg, and then sawing-away equally that lowest section of each leg; but for now, the existing height has been perfect. We stretched the fabric so it is very taut, and “stapled” it in place. This is done for the three walls with horizontal slats and also for the sleeping trampoline surface. We left about 2″ for “sag” of the mesh above the surface of the plywood base. We hand-sanded with common sandpaper, to remove any splinters that may have arisen during sawing and drilling of holes/screwing. And we were done! The assembly took me about 8 hours. Before assembly, I washed and gently sanded-down the various parts. I did not use paint or any form of chemical sealant/glue. The cost of screws, nuts and bolts were a few US dollars. The mesh materials awas probably about $8USD. The plywood I had was leftover from another house project. I always have leftover IKEA parts from earlier hacks, as well as other IKEA hacks-in-progress. Stretching the mesh taut, while stapling it into place. It really helps to have an assistant for that one portion of the job. There is no bending over. When it’s time to take our baby out of the crib, we lift and set aside the 1 wall of vertical bars; she can then be taken out of the crib with no bend-and-lift at all. When it’s time for her to go back into the crib, our baby is placed inside the 3 walls, and then we return the vertical bars into place, and we turn the wood latch so it’s all snug.  We also like the ventilation — it’s perfect. We would place a plastic liner on top of the platform, which is below the mesh trampoline. Why? We didn’t anticipate that anything the drips down through the mesh will land on the wooden base, and it’s not easy to clean that platform beneath the trampoline; a very simple plastic liner can be pulled in-and-out and easily cleaned. We use a simple pad now. ~ by Jim Wistman", "author": "Jules Yap", "date": "2021-10-12T09:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://ikeahackers.net/2021/10/ikea-trampoline-crib.html", "categories": ["ikea-hacks"], "tags": ["ikea", "hack", "diy"], "image_url": "https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/trampoline-crib-4-768x576.jpg", "excerpt": "The that was used when my son was an infant (1999) was stored away after he’d outgrown it.

I thought of using kitchen furniture but the normal fit in washing machine cabinet is too small. What do you suggest?” Photo: Sara Oliveira Hi Sara, IKEA has many organization options for the laundry room. You’ll be able to quite easily. Let’s take a look at what we can do. IKEA recommends the BOAXEL system for the laundry room. The wall mounted is ideal with a drying rack and adjustable shelves. Best thing, you’re not constrained by the size of a cabinet. Vertical space above the machine can be used effectively. Store items in crates or boxes for a neater finish. Photo: Also easily expandable if you want to organize the space next to your machine. Photo: IKEA recently rolled out a new modular storage system called ENHET. The ENHET is still pretty much under the radar but I’m already in love with it. IKEA positioned it for use in the kitchen or bathroom. But as far as I’m concerned it can go in every corner of the home. I think with open shelving and closed storage is perfect for your laundry corner. What do you think? Photo: is a popular solution for laundry rooms. And with good reason. Highly flexible, with open or closed storage, solid or glass doors. I used the and came up with two possible designs for you. Do poke around the and come up with the design of your dreams. For Design 1, I picked a High Cabinet Frame (40x60x200 cm) with an UTRUSTA pull-out cleaning tool storage. It’s optional and you can replace this with shelves or drawers. In the space above the machine, I chose two wall cabinet frames (80x37x60 cm), stacked. I left the bottom cabinet frame doorless to give the feel of open shelving. To further personalise it, consider to add your signature style. I wrapped all the sides of the kitchen cabinet frames with cover panels for a seamless finish. For Design 2, I opted for a simpler, lighter style. Use a to create a waterfall countertop. It will stretch across the base kitchen drawer unit (40x60x80 cm), over the washing machine and then down the sides of the machine. (Alternatively, .) Adjust the length of the countertop to fit your machine. The countertop would be useful for sorting out and folding up laundry. Above the machine, I went with 2 horizontal cabinet frames (60x37x80 cm) and glass doors. Next to it is a 40x37x80 cm frame with solid door. Finish with doors and knobs in the style you prefer. I love this solution for classy laundry room organization. Unfortunately the is not widely available. But it’s a neat and easy solution especially when you don’t want to make holes in the wall. Just slot the NYSJÖN above the machine. I do recommend securing it to the wall, as a top heavy cabinet may topple. Photo: The works in a similar way. But the shelves are not as deep (and appear a lot more wobbly), so may not fully optimise the vertical space. Is there anything the can’t do? Here’s what Jake did with the IVAR. You can trim the 80cm long shelves down to fit your machine like Jake.  You’ll need to use screws to attach them to the IVAR side units, if you cut off the mounting fixture. Photo: For a basic unit, all you need is two and some 80cm shelves. The will help stabilize the unit. Personally, I’ll omit the cutting and keep the shelves at 80cm. Then, set the machine flush against the left (or right) side post. In the approx. 20cm gap next to the machine, I’ll slot in a handy . At the top, I’ll use the to close it up.

Make sure to have any sharp edges of the zip ties facing out so that your fur babies won’t contact them from the inside. 5. Attach the carabiner and spring to the “door” and the “frame” so that you can secure the door in the closed position. This project was easily done over a weekend by one person, with the exception of lifting the heavy table top in place.  The most time consuming piece was getting the stickers off of the plastic dispensers.  But it was important that that side faced out so the inner side where the doggies sleep is smooth. The cost was around $150.00 That the final product is easy and lightweight.  The colors work in my room and it’s easy to dismantle if I wanted a change. I adjusted the opening where your legs go to be a bit bigger so I wouldn’t feel squeezed in.  One nice bonus that I hadn’t anticipated is that the changing table ends act as little “trenches” where I can store lots of desk supplies without sacrificing my big desk surface. The hardest part was figuring out what material to use for the crate sides.  Once I stumbled on the VARIERA dispensers, it was easy because the dimensions work nearly perfectly with the openings, and they were easy enough to cut with good scissors along the seam lines. I would pay attention to the size, weight, and temperament of your dogs to see if this would work for you.  My guys are not chewers and are very calm (and only 15 pounds each), so they seem very secure and snug.  They don’t push on the sides or try to get out. The build is solid but would likely not withstand a robust chewer. Looking back, I would consider adding casters to the bottom of the tables, but it was difficult finding ones that would fit the narrow legs of the SNIGLAR. I also did not attach the top to the bases, but it would likely be safer to do so. ~ by Alissa Davis", "author": "Jules Yap", "date": "2021-07-23T09:00:00-04:00", "url": "https://ikeahackers.net/2021/07/double-dog-crate-desk.html", "categories": ["ikea-hacks"], "tags": ["ikea", "hack", "diy"], "image_url": "https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sniglar-changing-table-white__0119722_PE276153_S4.jpg", "excerpt": "After I adopted my two little doggies, I was looking for a place for them to sleep in my room where they were secure.  Conventional crates were ugly and bulky.

One cabinet opens to the left and the other, to the right like your inspiration photo. The desk is a good fit (29 1/2″) with the length of the two SEKTION cabinets (a little under 29 inches) when they are positioned back to back. All you need to do is to secure the cabinet frames to each other. Then, cover the front with or a piece of plywood if you prefer a more realistic finish. Lastly, attach the worktop to the bottom piece with L brackets or with screws, drilling in from the cabinet up to the worktop. The MELLTORP may be hollow in some parts, so do install them where the screws can anchor in. Depending on how long your worktop is, adjust the distance between each cabinet to match. The ends of the cabinet should be flush with the edge of the tabletop. Then get two pieces of plywood cut to the size. Cover the front and back of the cabinets, including the space in between. This will secure the two cabinets to each other and create a single unit. Then attach the worktop to the bottom piece as per instructions above. If your find the many dowel holes unsightly, cover them with these . Finally, but very importantly, I would attach the desk / bar to the wall with appropriate fixings to minimise the risk of tipping.

{"title": "1 big or 2 small units: This portable KALLAX kitchen island is so useful", "content": "I’ve always wanted to have a and when moving into a new apartment, our small kitchen and limited countertop surfaces gave me the opportunity to create my dream kitchen island. I went for the KALLAX unit because I was looking for an affordable and easily DIYable solution. As I was looking for ideas on , I stumbled upon similar kitchen island projects which gave me the inspiration to make my own version of it. After all, it’s such a versatile piece that even if I change my mind in the future, I can use it as something else! Three things were key to my decision: lots of storage, a large enough surface area and the ability to move it between rooms. That’s why we opted for two 2×2 KALLAX shelving units instead of one bigger one (2×4), so that we could move at least one of the two units to the living room or patio and use it as a buffet trolley when we have people over. The below shows how I made my portable kitchen island from start to finish. Click the play button to watch. First, I assembled the two KALLAX shelving units as per instructions. Then, I attached the wheels.  I used two with a stopper, and two without for each unit. Then, I cut two pieces of countertop with a jigsaw.  I decided to make the overhang even on all sides so, about 4.7in x 4.9in (12cm – 12.5cm) on each side.  The total dimensions of the countertop after cutting are 25in x 35in (63.5 cm x 89 cm). To hide the cut edge, I attached some edge banding with a warm iron. Next, I spread some silicone glue on the top surface of the KALLAX and very carefully, glued the worktop down. You can also screw a couple of screws for extra security, underneath the surface of the KALLAX going up towards the countertop. Finally, I attached the door magnet on the edge of the bottom of one of the countertops and the metal corner on the edge of the other unit. I then, repeated on the other side. And that completes the DIY Kitchen Island project! When attaching the wheels, make sure that the wheel itself (and not the metal part that holds the wheel) is aligned with the edge of the unit, otherwise the two units won’t be able to connect. The most challenging part in creating this project was finding the correct magnets to attach. I had initially purchased a pair of 5kg door magnets but they weren’t strong enough, so I ended up using a pair of 20kg magnets instead. If I were to do it again, I would have opted for a pair of door hooks instead. Finally, attaching the worktop on KALLAX’s unit is definitely a two-person job if you want to make sure it is perfectly aligned and I would highly recommend making some markings on the countertop to help you with your alignment. It took me a few hours to complete it and cost me 170€.

The original controls for the sit/stand desk were extremely basic, with just two buttons — up and down. With these 2 buttons, you can adjust the height of the table top electrically from 65 to 125 cm to ensure an ergonomic working position. I like changing positions between sitting and standing, which helps me move my body and lessen the stiffness from sitting too long. Working standing up also makes me more alert. However, what I found lacking in the sit-stand desk was a height memory. I had to adjust the desk height manually each time I wanted a different position. I figured an upgrade from the basic Up and Down buttons was necessary. These were the original controls for the sit/stand desk with the two “Up” and “Down” buttons. But kudos to IKEA for managing to keep it so minimal. I wanted to attempt to control the movement of the IKEA Bekant Desk sit/stand height with M5Stack Core2 using two Relay units and a ToF (time-of-flight sensor VL53L0x) unit. It worked really well.

{"title": "“Colorful” RAST x 2 to Stacked MCM Dresser", "content": "My daughter and her partner had just moved back from England to Vancouver, Canada and had already spent a fortune on furniture basics for their very modern but small apartment. Space in their bedroom was limited by sq. footage and because of two capacious built-ins on either side of the bed, even side tables wouldn’t work. And the one space they could put an additional piece of furniture without banging into it, near the foot of their bed, would only allow for a 12 inch depth, particularly if the dresser had drawers to pull out. They had an IKEA TARVA headboard in unfinished pine and everything else was white. They liked the white/wood combo for a calm, inviting bedroom. So they were looking at an MCM dresser at that cost $459 Cdn dollars. It had a white box frame and a few beech colored drawers, on angled legs. It was tall but narrow and 16” from the wall, so was still too deep. I was staying with them for a short while and thought I could go one better, with actual pine to match their bed. A better fit for depth and width, and save them $400. Enter . Two of them. Used, crayoned, battered but free, from Craigslist. These beauties before: I turned them into this stacked MCM dresser: | I had no power tools with me so this makeover was built almost entirely with what my daughter had on hand: I bought in Cdn dollars: So the makeover without legs would have cost me $61 with tax. In the US, that cost would likely be less than $40 not only because of the exchange rate but because things are cheaper. I also bought the MCM legs and angled brackets for another $50 Cdn at . Moreover, the kids are still deciding on new pulls so there will be a cost for those. Myself, I would have just spray painted the existing knobs in silver or brass for another $6. But as of now, total makeover including taxes and MCM legs is Canadian $111, and less than $80 US. 1. Remove knobs, clean and sand everything down. I was only going to use four drawers of the six. So I kept back the two worst-crayoned ones, of which one drawer face was made into a shelf, and the backs of both of the drawers were used for side tables later. Sanding was easy – 15 minutes. Don’t press hard. Then use a damp paper towel or tack cloth to remove wood dust. 2. Construct the shape: The RAST bottom is hollow with just the two sides and a sunk back board at the front. I brought that board forward (outward) an inch or two, screwed it in on the sides, so it was flush with the front of the side boards, in order to achieve the boxy look I wanted. But I needed a proper bottom too in order to attach legs. There was an inner cross piece of wood further up the dresser that I removed. I glued, then screwed, this face-down on two of the discarded drawer sides, exactly squared off on the inner bottom, then screwed the crosspiece to the sides and the drawer pieces to the front piece. Very sturdy actually. This gave me the bottom. After painting I just screwed in the angled foot hardware in the four corners, then screwed the legs in. I removed the bottom front crosspiece from the second dresser, then stacked and glued the side legs to the first dresser. I reinforced this with 4 brackets on the inside of the top dresser’s legs connected to the bottom dresser’s top. Not ideal but I knew they would be painted over as to be hardly noticeable. The top of the bottom dresser made one shelf with a high space that my daughter wanted. But I wanted another to lay across the top drawer of the bottom section. No piece was deep enough. However, the crosspiece I had removed from the top dresser, jutted up against a discarded drawer face, made a perfect sized shelf. So I glued these together and flat-bracketed them. I removed the plastic drawer slides I wasn’t using, then nailed a pair to the sides for the shelf to rest upon. These slides were originally inserted into premade holes, but are surprisingly sturdy enough when turned backwards and nailed, though awkwardly. You should have a level for this part. The back of my new shelf slid right in flush to the sides so I screwed that part to the frame for extra reinforcement. The backs are thin pressboard and just nail tacked on but only cover half of each dresser. So I removed these and after painting them I re- tacked them to the back of the exposed shelving area, meeting behind the top shelf. And that was it for the build. None of the screwing or hammering was hard. I have little strength in my right wrist from a former fracture, so if I can do it so can you! And I spent a lot of time thinking about how to do all of this but only about an hour’s time actually doing it. 3. Painting: a) Make sure all screws and nails that will show are fastened in as tight as possible. Then wood putty over them. Fill all holes with wood putty. In some deep cases you can fill with the wood glue first. Sand smooth with long strokes. b) Sand medium all surfaces to be painted. Clean dust with damp towel or tack cloth. Wait half hour always if you do use damp towel so dampness dries before applying primer or paint. c) Two coats of shellac-based primer. Follow instructions on can for drying times. Lightly sand, just tickle, between coats and clean as above. d) Two or three coats of paint. Before the final coat do a sand with the finest sandpaper you have, 220 or up is best. e) Apply a quick coat of clear, not amber, poly with rag for best results. But I didn’t have any, and they didn’t want it on the pine drawer faces anyway. f) Reinstall drawers, attach legs if not already, same with backs. That might have been it except the RAST is a product that keeps on giving! Remember I said my daughter had no room for side tables because of the built-ins to either side? I had two solid drawer backs left so I just laid them inside each built-in drawer, over their clothes, and stabilized them with Command poster strips on the inner ridge. Now they have somewhere to rest a cup of coffee and a book! And their drawers still close — sans coffee cup of course! So it seems a lot but I did all the thinking for you! 4 hours and $111 or less than $80 US. Including tax my daughter saved $400 and got a better-suited and better-fitting MCM dresser, made of wood not laminate. Not to mention side tables! Fan-rast-ic! From this: To this: Likely only if I had similar space limitations. The RAST is the only suitable dresser I found at 12” depth. But I find the plastic slides cheap and stacking was harder and more costly than I thought. So was painting unfinished pine because of the priming and more costly shellac-based primer. There were a lot of holes to fill. These pieces were battered! I’ve stained a lot of furniture and painted over painted furniture and both were far easier and cheaper than this RAST MCM dresser project.

The hole will guide the screw through the wood and prevent it from from splintering. The brackets won’t be seen from the outside. 4. Measure and extract the inner shape of the stool. 5. Cut such shape in a 5mm plywood board. Pro tip: if you use a jigsaw, you can use a wooden strip as support to ensure cutting a straight line. 6. Use the leftovers to thicken the area where the screws will be. Glue them with CA and place the screws. 7. Using an old KIVIK couch cover, my mom (thanks mom!!) upholstered separately the cushion (including its base board) and the main body. 8. The edges are tucked in and stapled to the body walls and legs. 9. Screw the hinges to one of the walls and the cushion’s board. The result is just awesome!

{"title": "Turning 2 SVARTA loft beds into one big double loft bed", "content": "I felt like I had too little living space. I wanted a loft bed, but still loved my ‘old’ 160 x 200cm IKEA mattress. There seemed to be no IKEA or even other affordable 160 x 200 double loft bed options. Then, my boyfriend suggested getting two second hand IKEA loft beds and making it into one. I set out to find whether someone did this hack. I found many people asking if it could be done, but to my surprise, nobody seems to have documented trying it. So I decided to be the one to just do it and share it for anyone that wants to do it too. Photo: Of course, you can buy everything new. You have the option to choose the 2 wooden slatted bed bases like I did with a 180 x 200cm mattress. Or stick with the metal bed base provided and use two 90 x 200cm mattresses. (Though you might have a gap in between them). First, you take two of the four support beams (these will become the middle beams for your bed), and one long beam with the guard rail. I used the beam with the guard to figure out where to drill the middle hole in the other beams. Drill a hole size according to the bolt you have. Now, build your first bed. Attach the sides to the two support beams and add the guardrail without the opening for the ladder, all as instructed. Next, take one of the beams you’ve drilled a hole in. Instead of following instructions and putting the beam with the guardrail (the one with a ladder opening) you put the beam with the hole. Now, you are ready to do pretty much the same with the other bed. But the difference is that this time you put in the side with the guardrail that had the opening for the ladder. Next, this is the moment you put your two frames where they will go. Line up the two holes you drilled earlier and attach the two middle supports for the bed supports. Your one bolt should go through both supports and both beams. Fasten it until there is a slight tension on the beams and they are kind of being pulled together. (See picture taken from the underside of the bed.) Next up, put some of the felt in the inside of the adjustable metal hose clamps and put them around the two middle poles on each side. Put in your metal bed bases and ladder as per the original instructions. Add the wooden bed base of you choose that option. Just lay them on top of the metal ones. Add your mattress now or if you want to attach it to the wall for extra support, do that first. I added a picture of how I did it, there is more of the stick-on felt inside of the clamps. That’s it, put in your bedding and dream away on your giant loft! Setting up the SVARTA double loft bed took me about an afternoon, together with my boyfriend. And it cost about 30 euros in hardware. I already had the mattress and the bed bases, and we picked up the SVARTA bed frames second hand. Pay attention to the bolt in the middle being strong enough. It literally holds everything together. The height under the double loft bed is just 145 cm so you can not stand, but you can sit or store stuff under it. And check the height of your ceiling, it stands at almost 190 cm at the highest point but you would not want to have too little space to sit up. You could also add two ladders by using the other guard rail. Also this beast of a bed takes 198×208 cm floor space excluding the ladder. So it takes up quite a bit of space. Big plus about using my way of doing it is that it is non destructive. Meaning, you can always turn them back into two regular IKEA SVARTA loft beds. Also only a few tools and pieces of hardware are needed this way. I absolutely love the bed and with it being attached to the wall it is verry sturdy. And it can sleep two people, no problem.

Then, I measured out how much space I needed to hang and maneuver my brooms and my cleaning supplies. I cut approximately three quarter of an inch from the bottom of the wall cabinet to line up where the shelving holes lined up on the high cabinet. Half an inch was cut at the back of the side and top of the wall cabinet so it was able to align with the sides of the high cabinet from front to back. I did not use the back that was supplied with the wall cabinet. Dowel holes were drilled into the bottom shelf of the high cabinet and dowels were glued in. I assembled the left half of the wall cabinet and secured it to the right side of the high cabinet [as if it was the right side of the wall cabinet] using the supplied binding post screws and connector nuts while aligning the dowels on the bottom shelf with the holes in the bottom of wall cabinet. Once everything was assembled and leveled, I installed the shelves where I wanted them. I also needed to hang my brooms. The first thing was to measure how deep I needed the KUNGSFORS rail to be to fit inside the cabinet. Then, I cut about 2 1/2 inches off the rail. The insert at the ends of the rail for screwing it to the side popped right out and easily back in after the cut. It was assembled and screwed into place. Voilà! I have a utility cabinet.

It was refreshing to be away from my devices and reconnect with family and friends. I hope you had a wonderful time closing the year and ushering in the new one. To be honest, 2021 is still up in the air for me. I’m still calling this year, next year. (The brain is slowly, chugging on, still processing 2020.) So I’ll take my time to ease into all this newness rather than jump right in. The plan is to take this first two weeks to reflect, pray and move with more intention than reaction. Will 2021 be more of 2020? No one knows. I’m not looking for that certainty. Rather, I’m looking to faith which gives my inner world an anchor when all is an ever changing landscape. I pray you’ll find your inner footing too. And with that let’s kick off 2021 with this very doable candle fireplace hack from Annalisa. ~ Jules I wanted to create a candle fireplace using two LACK tables that I already had and on which the TV was already placed. I removed one front leg from each table and joined the two tables by fixing wooden slats underneath so that it became a single large table. (You can also use the (90 x 55cm). For my case, I used the two square ones because I already had them). Then, I raised the table by 10 cm using the removed LACK legs. I attached them with glue and tape. Let the glue dry thoroughly. (You can also use pieces of wood to raise the height of the fireplace.) After that, I cut out the corrugated sheets, obtaining suitably sized panels to put both inside and outside. And also some for the front to create the frame. (Click the photos below to enlarge and see the process). I lined the bottom panel with a faux brick effect double-sided adhesive paper. Then, on the two internal side panels, I lined with white double-sided adhesive paper. The internal faux brick panel I placed it inside but not too far, but a little further on, using scotch tape and pieces of wood as separators, so the fireplace is not come too deep. Then, I applied the internal side panels. I applied the white double-sided adhesive paper to cover the tables externally and on the upper side, taking care to make it adhere well without bubbles. Then, I applied to the front and lateral frame profiles and wooden decorative pieces which I already painted with white paint.

Hope my ideas will be suitable for your boys’ room. Firstly, the easel. I’m assuming it’s a ? Even if it isn’t, it doesn’t matter. An easel does not necessarily have to take up floor space. You can mount it on the wall or on the side of a wardrobe. So don’t ditch it yet, you may still find space for it. You can disassemble it and blend it seamlessly into the room. You can even turn one side into a magnetic board if you wish. (Good for hanging metal pen containers). . Here’s another idea. How about using the flat sides of the TROFAST unit as drawing surfaces? I would suggest having two TROFAST units back to back to get a larger drawing surface. Add a piece of wood, such as MDF or plywood to the two sides to join the two units together and get two flat surfaces. can be fixed on to the flat side of the TROFAST using a to contain pens and crayons, then a on curtain rods. You can also paint the side with , if your kids want to switch between paper and chalk. An even easier way to add the paper would be to use the . Use screws to drill from under the TROFAST up into the paper holder. A rough sketch of the idea would be as follows: On the other flat surface, stick on a . Finally, add casters wheels to the bottom so you can access storage on the other side. Use wheels with brakes so the TROFAST easel won’t move around when your kids draw. Anne has an excellent tutorial on turning , complete with paper rolls. In the long run, this may be a good solution as it will provide to do so much more than draw. And you don’t lose out on storage.

But we have quite a lot of drawers so it’s going to work out really expensive… What alternatives do people use that fit the drawers properly?” Kristy recommends using the KOMPLEMENT drawer organizers sparingly, and positioning them smartly.

That way I can fold smaller things into the organisers, and larger things just into the drawers.” Go for the cheaper . At the price of $6.99 for a set of 6, it is a great pocket-friendly option. And the boxes work just as well as the more luxurious, felt KOMPLEMENT drawer organizer. To store them, unzip the boxes and fold flat. However, since the SKUBB boxes are not specifically designed for the KOMPLEMENT drawers you will not be able to fit 6 SKUBB boxes perfectly in one KOMPLEMENT drawer.

But adding a few pieces of well-placed can totally change the look of the bed. All the while keeping it light and airy. Alternatively, rather than adding, opt to strip it down for a calm “I’m-not-a-child-anymore” bed. The jungle theme or safari is a fun one. Add a curtain rod to the side panel and hang plants off it.

He asked me to spray paint them in bronze color. However, after I painted the cabinet doors, I wanted some of the original “airiness” back, so I used the cane. It turned out so lovely, I am looking around my house for other places that might need the SVALNÄS installed! SVALNÄS workspace combination | I painted, in a garage, and kept the brackets/doors elevated with wood blocks under them to ensure an even coat. Because I painted in light layers—and there were so many brackets—it took about two days. I chose NOT to paint the small hardware used to attach the brackets to the uprights because I did not want to risk losing those pieces in the process. The cane sheets arrived in one long roll. I laid it out and put heavy books on it to straighten the cane. After a day or so, it still rolled up too easily.  Instead, I soaked the cane roll in the bathtub overnight, then laid it out again with the heavy books. That worked! I originally planned to adhere the cane sheets to the cabinet door fronts, but the caning made the door edges too wide to fit into the appropriate slots when assembling the cabinets. Instead, I cut the cane sheets to nest inside the BACK of the Cabinet doors which has a lip around it which creates an inset. I first used a spray adhesive, but it was not strong enough to keep the cane in place. Eventually, I dropped in spots along the cane and, with a pair of gloves on, gently spread the glue across the entire cane surface, pressing the cane firmly against the painted metal door. After each door was no longer tacky to the touch, I laid it flat and put some heavy pots or books on them and let them rest for 24 hours. Now, the back of the cabinet doors are now the front of the cabinet doors. Next, I followed the instructions for the assembly and installation, with two exceptions: I added contact paper to the desk drawers and across the back of the cabinet prior to assembly. I also used some green patina painted wood cabinet knobs I already had on hand instead of the knobs that came with the desks/cabinets. I had to add some washers to the screws to get them to fit in the older knobs. After the assembly and installation was complete, I slid the doors into place. Not necessary, but they help protect the desk/cabinet tops from scratching. This took four days, due to patience\nwith paint and glue and other time demands.

First, she masked the parts of the lamp she wanted to keep white with sticky tape. This part is most time consuming. The laser part was tricky, so she drew the pattern on a big piece of tape and cut it out using a scalpel, then applied it carefully to the lamp. Then, she paint the exposed parts with plastic paint, twice over, to get a good cover. . Simon spray painted the tiles grey before assembling them. After they were dry, he assembled the lamp and began masking the lines. Next thing was to use a compass to draw a series of circles to create the laser weapon of the Death Star. After which he began painting the laser rings. Lastly, using a toothbrush dipped in black paint, he gave the grey areas a speckled look. . Maria used a can of light grey spray paint from the hardware store to spray the tiles. If you want to have it perfect — cover the copper insides BEFORE you spray paint the outsides, as the mist of the spray will dull the sheen. You’ll end up with an light grey ball after assembling it like the instruction tells you. Then, use masking tape to cover the areas that should stay lighter. Use an X-acto knife and a cutting mat with a ruler to make variations in the strips. Cut some wide, some small, some long, some short. Alternate to create the pattern, the Death Star wasn’t all the same, neither should be yours. Maria then created a stencil of the round laser weapon on a piece of paper. And traced that onto the Lamp with a pencil. She’s provided a scanned template of the laser in 3 versions. The template was drawn by hand so it was hard to get a clear scan. But you may still be able to use it as a starting point for a template. It fits on a sheet of A4 paper and is meant for the 52 cm diameter version — for the smaller ones you’ll need to size it down. This step took a good bit of patience but it’s worth to take your time and go wild on details. Once you’re satisfied with the look of your pattern, you can paint a darker shade of paint over the whole ball. Maria felt that black was too dark and sharp a contrast, so she mixed a darker grey colour from acrylic paint and a chalk paint. This gives it a not so glossy finish. Paint the ball completely or work in segments — it all depends on your taste. Lastly, they peeled the masking tape not long after painting. Make sure to press the tape down well before painting to avoid leaks and blotches. But even if you have some slight uneven lines — the end result will be great. The Death Star has so many little bits and dots, it will look like you wanted it this way 😉 The round weapon was painted by hand with a fine brush. Hang it on your ceiling as instructed.

{"title": "Make a beautiful and affordable Guitar Humidor", "content": "If you own a decent guitar you might be tempted to for ease of access and decoration. However, guitars need consistent humidity levels, and most of us don’t have humidity controlled rooms … So the default is to keep your beautiful instrument hidden in its case. A guitar humidor is an elegant solution – but they can – way out of my budget. I looked around for quite a while before I realized I could hack a standard IKEA display cabinet to build an attractive and functional guitar humidor for around $280. My hacked IKEA guitar humidor cabinet maintains a consistent 48% – 50% humidity level even when the ambient room humidity is below 40%. It allows easy access to the guitar, lets me admire the guitar when not in use, and my guitar case goes out of sight into a closet. Thanks IKEA! This hack is for a single guitar – but you may be able to wedge two guitars inside depending on their dimensions and how you install their hangers. Purchase an , 31 7/8” x 13 3/4” x 48 3/8″ (item # 104.151.98), which is tall enough to contain a standard guitar and has glass doors for admiring your investment. $195.a) The HAVSTA line is modular, so if you have the cash you can incorporate this into a larger wall unit with a base cabinet or shelves, bookshelves, and other options. Up to you. The remainder of these instructions are for the guitar cabinet only. i. If you only want the display case, invest in the base kit. $20. b) This is a solid wood product (yes, it’s the typical IKEA glued-up construction, but it’s real wood), except for the back panel, which is a thin pressed board material. We’ll deal with that later. c) I chose gray, but they come in brown-black and white as well. If you’re motivated, you could repaint…or if you’re really motivated, strip and restain all the pieces to the color of your choice prior to assembly. If this is you, have fun. Do the IKEA build thing. During main cabinet assembly, pause after installing the back panel. a) Apply a to the interior seams of the main cabinet walls, ceiling, floor, and back. This will seal the static components of the cabinet. $5. The doors represent the biggest sealing challenge. Before installing the cabinet doors, apply to the outer edge of the cabinet doors. This stuff is pretty cheap, so buy a couple different sizes. $5. a) This will seal the gap between the outer door edge and the cabinet walls – one of the biggest offenders. Install the hinges and cabinet doors, but do not complete the hinge adjustments yet. a) Do not install the lower or upper metal door stops. Repurpose one of the included interior shelves to provide a horizontal seal at the top and bottom of the glass doors. a) Using a handsaw, cut the long sides of the shelf away from the short sides. This should give you two long slim boards of the exact length required (thanks IKEA!). Discard the short pieces. b) Critical Step – take your time here. Glue / clamp the slim boards to the bottom and top of the cabinet at a depth that will allow the doors to close tightly against them when properly adjusted. i. IMPORTANT: the slim boards should be exactly parallel to the front edge of the cabinet for a  consistent horizontal seal. ii. I set mine 20mm back from the cabinet edge, which seemed about right, but the hinge adjustments let you fudge this a little. iii. You may want to have a partner help you play around with this step before gluing – once you do this you’re stuck (pun intended). c) If you’re unmotivated or don’t have a saw, you could simply glue the entire shelf to the top and bottom of the cabinet – but this is inelegant, and I know you’re not that person. Install a thin board to cover the door-to-door (center) gap. Cut to match the vertical space between the slim boards you just installed (i.e. should not extend the full height of the doors). Glue the board to the inside face of one door so that the other door overlaps when closed. a) I used a 1/4” x 2 1/2” x 48” . $4. b) I used some spray paint primer to give my board a gray color similar to the cabinet prior to install. Not an exact match but you can’t see it when the doors are closed. Adjust door hinges (per instructions) to maximize door-to-slim board contact and minimize the door-to-door center gap. a) This can take some time to get right, so go slow and don’t get frustrated. If you’re reading this, you’re already winning at life. b) Additional weatherstripping could be applied here, but I got mine to seal adequately without it. IKEA recommends screwing the cabinet to a wall to prevent tip-over. This isn’t an issue in my household, so I simply covered the anchor holes with duct tape applied to the rear side of the back panel. If you want to screw it into a wall, follow the directions but seal the screws from the inside of the cabinet with silicone. Install a guitar hanger of your choice. $10 – $25. This is where you can customize the installation based on your specific needs. a) My choice: Install a screwed to the back of the cabinet at the appropriate height for your guitar. i. Since the cabinet back is thin pressboard, install a 3/4” x 3 1/2” board on the back of the cabinet to properly support your guitar’s weight. I used a combination of glue and two pocket screws to secure this board which runs vertically down the center line of the cabinet back. The bottom screw is the most important since the torque of the guitar’s weight wants to push the bottom of the board away from the cabinet. $5. b) Other options: Install a screwed to the top of the cabinet (solid wood), or use a screw-in plant hanger and a leather strap to hang the guitar from the cabinet top (solid wood). c) Or … Simply lean the guitar inside the cabinet with appropriate support / cushion material where needed. I think a hanger is more secure, but you do you. Install a humidification mechanism. a) I used a that sits in the bottom corner of my cabinet. Low maintenance and can be adjusted to maintain your desired humidity level. $35. b) Guitar case humidifier(s) might work, but they’re designed for much smaller volumes than the magnificent guitar humidor cabinet you just built.

So … I started off with the 6 x units, assembling them as per instructions. shelf unit | I measured up 20cm from the bottom of each cube, and 5cm in from the back of each cube, on both sides and marked with pencil. Then, I carefully drilled 17mm holes all the way through the middle shelf and only through the first layer of the outer sides (left & right). Next, I measured across the KALLAX unit (77cm) and cut the RÄCKA poles to approx. 75cm each. I then disassembled each KALLAX and fed the RÄCKA poles through the holes so they rested on the outer edges as below. I did this top and bottom for all 6 x KALLAX units. The RÄCKA poles act as a stopper for 12” vinyl records, without having to board up the back of the unit. It means all vinyl sit neatly, approx 15mm inside the shelf. Next it was time to make a worktop for the flight case that has 2 x and a mixer. I had a LINNMON table top cut to size and the nice edge of the cut off glued back on, so it looked like it had never been cut! Next up was the legs for the table top — 2 x 4 packs of CAPITA 16cm adjustable stainless steel legs. I turned the LINNMON table top upside down. And carefully marked and attached the CAPITA legs to the underside of the LINNMON. Positioned them so they would rest nicely on top of the 2 KALLAX units. This now gave the the correct height to set the flight case on. I needed room underneath the LINNMON table top for an AV Receiver, PlayStation & Sky Box as they feed the projector mounted on the ceiling which projects to the big screen at the front of the room. The CAPITA legs are ideal for this as they are adjustable in height. Then it was time for the finishing touches … up next was a BJÄRNUM foldable hook for my headphones which I simply screwed on to the front of the KALLAX. When not required it can be nearly closed up. Then it was time for some trick lighting … I researched and researched and found the on Amazon. I chose the 10m pack (2x5m rolls).

So my husband and I decided to repurpose it. We made a chalkboard kids’ art desk with a mini shelf on top. Best thing is we reused the original bolts and only needed to make two additional holes. We use the original hanging changing table baskets to store crayons, chalks, colouring pencils, magnets, etc. And, we couldn’t be more pleased with how it’s turned out — we’ve converted a piece of furniture that lost usefulness after a year into something that will last well into childhood! | We took the top and bottom shelves out of the changing table, including the side supports. I took the centre shelf out, cut the magnetic chalkboard roll to size and stuck it to the centre shelf, then put the centre shelf (now chalkboardy!) back in place. We reassembled the back supports on both top and bottom shelves. For the bottom shelf, the front support was turned at a 90 degree angle and screwed in using its original bolts into a pair of holes that existed to hold the side pieces on about 2/3rds of the way to the back. This provided structural stability. My husband drilled a hole through each side about 2/3rds of the way to the back on the top. With the front support for the top shelf flipped upside down, the groove to hold the shelf was perfectly level with the groove on the back support. My husband cut one of the shelves to fit the new 1/3rd depth shelf on top and reassembled the desk for the final time. 1. You could do this without the drilling or cutting if you forgo the top shelf — just screw the front support into the side holes left by the side supports. It won’t be level to insert the shelf, but it will enhance structural stability with less effort. 2. Use chalkboard paint or just leave the middle shelf blank to make a simpler desk. 3.

{"title": "Custom integrated closet to hide unsightly electricals", "content": "In order to hide the ventilation box and solar roof inverter in our son’s room in the attic, I built a framework and put IKEA PAX FORSAND doors in front of it. there was just a plain wall. I forgot to make many pictures. But the frame is pretty straightforward: horizontal beams along the floor and ceiling. Vertical ones at the same distances that I measured from the original in our bedroom. Then I covered the frame with 20cm wide MDF to cover the gaps. the toe kick is at the same distance as the the original PAX toe kick. Because of the roof incline, I had to cut of the corners of two doors, which was a bit scary. (Would the construction of the door remain stable?) So I glued a strip over the newly cut edge. The left most door is made out of a panel from a DIY shop, because cutting off the entire left side would remove the inner left beam and render that door unstable. Because the walls are not perfectly perpendicular, the resulting surface is somewhat crooked, so adjusting the doors was (still is) a challenge. On the inside, I added acoustic padding so that the ventilation noise is significantly reduced (appr. 30dB). In hindsight, I would have used a toe kick, so I did not have to move the lower hinges upward. It would also leave some more headroom for the upper hinges under the roof incline. It took me about 4 full days as a relatively inexperienced DIY amateur to finish this custom integrated closet. And it cost well … 5 IKEA doors and under 100 euro in other materials.

{"title": "IKEA SYMFONISK lives loud as a folded horn speaker", "content": "I’m not that young anymore (born in 1965, the year of Moore’s law) but I’ve been interested in technology and engineering since I was young. My uncle Hubert inspired me: he helped me setting the first steps in electronics. He also gave me some old magazines, more than 30 years ago. The April 1964 issue of the Dutch magazine “Radio Bulletin” contained the building plan of a folded horn speaker (designed by Dipl. Ing. H.H. Klinger), which I built once when I was about 18 years old. It sounded fantastic. With the release of the speaker I was wondering if that modern technology could fit in a scaled folded horn. And if it could be hacked in an IKEA shelf. The base element (602.459.62) seemed to be a good match: scaling the design to 49% would do the job. Initially I wanted to build it using only shelves, but that didn’t work out. IKEA engineered these shelves such that they are light and strong, using a honeycomb structure. So I started over using fiberboard. Hollow core structure in BESTÅ shelves I just completed building it and the BoomBESTISK to me now sounds as a while it costs less than a . Named it ‘BoomBESTISK’ based on ,  BESTÅ and SYMFONISK. I hope you like it too. 1. Be sure to apply glue/kit between all panels mounted to make all connections airtight. I used screws and glue everywhere. 2. Start building the BESTÅ base element: connect bottom plate and sides. 3. Cut the BESTÅ shelf from 56 cm x 36 cm to 56 cm x 32.3 cm. Mount it vertically at 24 cm from the front of the base element. Use glue at the sides. I used the cut off part of the shelf at the rear side to fix it. 4. Cut a 20.6 cm piece of the lumber and mount that on the bottom of the base element (yes: glue + screws) at 46.3cm from the left inner side of the BESTÅ base element. Cut a 30.5 cm piece to and mount that onto the rear side. Fiberboard panel f will be mounted at the left side of this L shape. 5. From there the labyrinth is built, from top-right to left. This is a difficult and time consuming part. For panels that are hard to mount firmly, use parts of the aluminum angle bar (20mm x 20mm). 6. Note that I didn’t use panels m, n, o and p. I constructed the wedge using 9 trapezium shaped parts that were glued, tacked and screwed. 7. Drill the hole in the right side of the BESTÅ base element to be able to secure the top plate later on. Avoid damage by drilling with a piece of wood clamped onto the BESTÅ panel. 8. Mount panel f’ at the right inner side of the BESTÅ base element. Cut a 20,6 cm piece of the lumber and mount that on the bottom of the base element, it should neatly fit in. Cut a 30.5 cm piece and mount that onto the panel f’. 9. Cut pieces of lumber that fit on the bottom between the different panels. 10. Cut a 30.5 cm piece of lumber and mount that onto the right side of panel i. Cut a 30.5 cm piece to and mount that onto the left side of panel g. 11. At this time, the only panels left are the top of the BESTÅ base element, the rear panel of the BESTÅ base element and panel d. 12. Drill a 75 mm hole in the rear panel between panels f and f’. This will later be used to feed cables and wifi antennas to the rear. 13. Disassemble the SYMFONISK (tip: below). Do not cut any cable. Be careful: do not damage the flex PCB. Keep all parts. 14. Cut out the SYMFONISK front panel with the buttons and LED using a multitool. Then use a saw to make the cuts straight. 15. Mount the SYMFONISK metal cooling plate on a piece of fiberboard (I reused the part that I cut from panel g) using glue & screws. Mount the SYMFONISK electronics panel with 4 screws onto the cooling plate. Apply weatherstrip at the rear of the fiberboard panel. 16. Connect and secure the mains cable. Put isolation tape around this too (not shown in the picture). Feed this cable through the 75mm hole in the rear. 17. Connect a network cable to the electronics board. Feed this cable through the 75mm hole in the rear. 18. Mount the electronics assembly at the right side. I used only 2 screws in the top part. 19. Put the wifi antennes through the 75 mm hole in the rear. Mount them in 2 different directions using double sided tape. 20. Apply kit/glue on top of all wooden parts. Mount and secure the top plate of the BESTÅ base element. 21. Apply weatherstrip at the front sides of all panels and lumber. In the picture you see that I initially forgot one strip. 22. Drill the 75 mm hole for the woofer and the 38 mm hole for the tweeter in panel d. 23. Cut out a hole for the SYMFONISK front panel. This is a difficult and time consuming step: this front panel has to fit tightly in the hole. 24. Cut the BESTÅ base element rear panel: one of the size of the panel d, and one of the size of panel i. Let’s call these finish panels d’ and i’. 25. Make sure to have the holes in finish panel d’ match the ones in panel d. Glue panels d and d’. 26. Glue panel i’ to panel i. 27. Mount the speakers at the back of panel d using screws. Note that there’s not a lot of room for the speakers and connectors. 28. Connect speakers and SYMFONISK front panel. You might want to test if everything already works. 29. Mount panel d using 6 screws with the lumber mounted to panels f’, g and i. Drill holes first such. By screwing it, the speaker can always be opened again in case of issues. 30. Cut a 32.3cm piece of the aluminum angle bar (10mm x 20mm) and glue it between panels d and i. 31. Use the speaker front panel of the SYMFONISK to mark the holes to have it mounted. Drill 8mm holes and mount the inserts using kit. Tip: put tape on the drill to mark the required depth. Mount the SYMFONISK speaker front panel. Make sure that all glue has dried before using the BoomBESTISK. Plug & play music.

It looks miles better than the . 110 euros about 2 – 3 hours of work before after Measure your piano / keyboard length and width. Purchase a LINNMON table top at least 10cm longer than your piano. The table top should be 2- 3 times wider than your piano as you will need to cut the table top in three strips. One for the base, one for the backing and one for the top cover. My keyboard is 132cm x 30cm, so I bought the 150x75cm LINNMON table top. Measure the width of your piano and cut the first strip for the base, it should be 4cm wider than your piano width in order to accommodate the backing strip. My piano is 30cm and I cut the base at 34cm. Make sure that you cut the base strip with the finished straight edge showing at the front. For the top cover, measure from the back of your piano to the start of the piano keys or keyboard controls. Remember to include the extra 4cm needed for the backing strip. My piano controls started at 7cm so adding the 4cm, I measured and cut the top cover strip at 11cm. Make sure that you cut the cover with the finished straight edge showing at the front. From the table top you should be left with a middle strip (with no finished edging). Measure the height of the piano and cut the backing strip 1cm taller. My piano is 15cm in height, so I cut the backing strip at 16cm. The cut LINNMON pieces … For the side strips, cut the LACK wall shelf exactly the same width of the base strip. So I cut the side strips at 34cm. Then placed the two side strips together on the backing strip, made a mark and cut the backing strip to size. Make sure that you cut the side strips with the finished straight edges showing at the front and top. A piano keyboard height measured from the floor to the top of the white keys should be somewhere between 72 and 74cm. So I placed the piano on the base strip and measure from the bottom of the base to the top of the white keys, I have 17cm from base to the top of the white keys. Next measure and cut the LALLE legs keeping in mind the height of your previous measurement to the top of the white keys. I cut the LALLE legs at 56cm, with the 17cm, it brought the measurement to the top of the white keys to 73cm. Check if your keyboard has speakers on the bottom of the unit. If so you will need to cut out holes the same size as the speakers. Place your keyboard on the base strip and take the measurement of the speakers. The LINNMON table top is mostly made of paper so I used a to cut out the holes. Also make sure to measure and cut out a small hole on the backing strip allowing space for the plug lead. Using a power drill screw the LALLE legs into the base strip and also screw in the backing strip and side strips. This is a difficult process as the LINNMON and LACK are essentially paper but they have some chipboard sections at the side, you need to try and drill your screws into these sections. One could also use wood glue if that suits. Finally turn over your keyboard stand. Plug in your keyboard and fix the top cover with screws or a little wood glue.

The end result looks like a designer armchair at a fraction of the price. First thing he did was remove the powder coated steel frame from the seat. The plan was to reuse all the “soft” parts of the chair and hack a new wooden frame from Sapele lumber. He then made a cardboard template of the frame. Next, he planed the lumber and cut them to size, according to his template. Next was to test and join the parts together. Scripto used dowels for joints to avoid using any hardware. With everything in place, he applied glued and clamped the parts tight. Set aside to cure. Repeat for the legs. After the glue has dried, it was time for the stress tester to do its job. Judging from its face, it passed. All edges of the frame were sanded and routed for a smooth, curved finish. The last step was to finish with a coat of polyurethane. You can see the effect of the finish in the photo below. One before and the other after the polyurethane. And voilà! The new frame totally elevates the look of the armchair. Here’s a closer look at the wood detail. It’s so good, he made a pair. It took him around 10-20 hours, with the bulk of the time spent in planning.

A working sink on my DUKTIG play kitchen", "content": "Justin’s 2 year old daughter goes to a Montessori-style preschool during the week, and the first thing she does upon arrival is walk over to the sink, dispense some soap, wash and dry her hands all by herself. Which prompted the thought — if she can do this on her own at school, there must be a way to make the same thing possible at home. They received a DUKTIG playset as a gift last year. All the parts, as we know, are for pretend play and nothing actually works. Justin figured the toy faucet and basin were easy to remove and modify into a real working, fully functioning kitchen sink. And he did. Yes! That’s running water. A real working faucet! He started sketching out ideas until he came up with some thing that worked. All the modifications are non-permanent except for the drain hole drilled in the plastic play sink. It was also entirely self-contained and costs only about $30 in parts. All in, it took under an hour to install. IKEA DUKTIG play kitchen (~$15.00) (~$15.00) Optional Steel Grate for Drain Filtering (~$4.00) Basically, you’ll need to remove the faucet from the DUKTIG and replace it with the electronic water pump faucet. Then, make a hole a the bottom of the sink for the water to drain. The tubing for the pump goes into a hole drilled into the side of the 2-gallon jug. Now for the drainage. The storage space under the countertop is sacrificed for a 2-gallon water jug. In this option the water pours back into the jug. Probably not the best in terms of cleanliness but it requires less maintenance as the water is recirculated. You got to change the water as it will get dirty. Justin also lays out a second circulatory system with two tanks at the base of the sink (one for clean water and one for drainage) . And that’s all you need to do. Turn on the switch and watch it happen! Complete the sink with kitchen accessories like a drying rack, scrub brush and toy kitchen utensils. Your child will have lots of creative play washing dishes, pans and learning valuable skills in doing a little “housework”. Hop over to Justin’s blog to see the of the IKEA DUKTIG play kitchen with working sink. This modified play kitchen has a working digital kitchen timer (and shows the current time, when not counting down). In the end, it actually beeps! Did I mention that the oven is lit during the countdown? . My daughter loves her DUKTIG play kitchen set, and was always asking for a fridge, which IKEA doesn’t sell. Figuring out how to hack a play fridge was the hard part, afterwards assembly was done in roughly 30 minutes.

{"title": "Old wardrobe gets second life as a retro arcade machine", "content": ". We were dismantling our son’s TRYSIL Wardrobe to remove it from his room. It had been good wardrobe but the backing had started to continuously fall away. It had some slight damage during dismantling and would have become landfill apart from a last minute idea…. A retro arcade machine! It actually looks pretty retro, and it plays like a real arcade machine. First, dismantle the wardrobe (if it is already assembled). Separate the 2 tall side pieces ( Leave hanging rod brackets ON! 2 x shelf pieces, 2 x drawer fronts, and any assorted bolts and screws. Dowel rods can be removed – I didn’t use them) Mark out the side pieces to make 2 cuts. Side Panel cutting Guide This allows the cabinet to lean back at a neat angle. Ensure you identify the top and bottom correctly and take care to use the nicely edged side to stand towards the front. Cut with if possible. I used a so cut is quite rough. Mark out and drill pilot holes through sides to attach shelves between the 2 side panels. Use the long IKEA hex bolts that came with the TRYSIL to secure the shelves. On mine the middle shelf for controls is fitted at 93cm high and slopes very slightly toward the front. Once it is standing up use additional screws to fit the drawer fronts at the top. These are actually a little wider than the shelves but I squeezed mine in without cutting. But if you are better with a saw than I am you may wish to cut these down slightly to fit. I also fitted the rear one at an angle and only used 1 screw on each side so it can flip up to access the TV. Check that everything is holding together nicely then use 4 L-brackets to reinforce the structure. I added an extra 2 brackets to the middle shelf for extra sturdy controls. Now, if you left on the hanging rod holders and measured correctly I found that the TV sat at the perfect height to support the 30” TV we had, donated by my in-laws. I then fitted 2 screws in each top corner to allow TV to rest at the perfect viewing angle. And that’s all I did for the cabinet. If you want there are many other pieces that could be used to enclose the back of the cabinet and under the TV as well. (Again – I didn’t cut too much as I only had a jig saw and it cut this stuff very rough!). There are many instructional on Youtube on how to build an arcade games machine with a and Retro Pie. But here are the basic steps to fitting the joysticks and buttons to the USB controller, then connecting those to your Raspberry Pi mini computer. First, search for a button layout online or design your own on a piece of paper. Use this as a guide to drill holes for joystick and large buttons (28mm drill bit worked for me. Also some smaller buttons were 18mm I think – check your button sizes as they may vary). I did all this with the cabinet assembled. The buttons should just drop in and screw tight and the joystick requires placement and a couple of short screws underneath. The joystick kit comes with cables to attach to the USB board. These can also be fixed with a small screw or two. Then, take care to wire both player 1 and player 2 buttons in the same order as this will make the joystick configuration in the Retro Pie interface much easier. The cabinet build took me about 3-4 hours, but I was making it up as I went along. Fitting in the joysticks and buttons took me about 2 hours. Programming Raspberry Pi computer was easy to do with lots of online tutorials. That took about 1 hour. Fitting the cabinet parts together. You may need another person to assist holding pieces in place while assembling the cabinet. Cutting the large pieces so that the rubber edging remains in-tact for front edges of cabinet, which makes a nicer finish. Be careful fitting the shelves as they are not particularly thick. They definitely need support with L-brackets. No, it actually turned out almost exactly as I envisaged.

Only a couple of steps, because the base items are so well suited for this conversion. We already know that has a long history. But the thing is, we were not really familiar with the styles. So here is our version for our son. BEKVÄM step stool | 1. Build a stock BEKVÄM, without attaching its upper step. Set aside. 2. Then on the second BEKVÄM, cut both the sides, according to the picture. (part 1 and 2) The elbow like section should be cut off entirely. But the other, straight section may be left there, depending on your needs. In our case the cut was made at 90cm above ground, so the whole tower can be placed under our worktop. With this measurement, the top edge of the part labelled No. 3 is on the same level as the cut sides. And the frame’s spread is almost the same as the original BEKVÄM’s. So basically this is the symmetric solution which can produce a neat hourglass shape. 3. Cut the second BEKVÄM’s upper step as seen in the picture below to create the backrest. Aim for the corners, and be sure to cut along at a 5° angle. 4. Assemble the sides and the already cut upper step. Use screws and/or with glue. 5. Pre-assemble the frame with the uncut upper step. Position the part No. 4 behind the sides, and mark where the 5° angle cuts should be. Make the cuts, and attach the part to the frame. 6. Attach the frame to the stock BEKVÄM’s upper step. 7. Use the stock screws to attach the finished frame to the BEKVÄM’s legs. And the learning tower high chair is ready to use. Here as a learning tower. You may try it as a high chair as well.

They’re actually sold as “doll beds” at IKEA! (in some countries) and it’s probably than make, but it’s hard to deny . My partner and I bought one of these IKEA DUKTIG doll beds on a whim after a friend got one. I actually went back to IKEA just days later to get a second one. With two larger than average cats in the house there would be no sharing. After seeing some photos of folks who had double (or triple) bunked these little beds, I knew I had to do the same. I looked around for an explicit “how to make a cat bunk bed” post but couldn’t find one, so I thought I’d make one myself. You don’t have to be handy or have any special tools to do this project, just a screwdriver or drill, 2 x pre-assembled IKEA DUKTIG doll beds, 16 x wood screws, and 2 x 4″x7/8″ mending plates. First, remove the board from the bottom of the DUKTIG beds and set them on their sides. Line up the posts and place the mending plate so that it is spread equally across both posts. The next step is to attach the mending plates to each of the posts. I stood mine up just to make sure everything looked right. Then, tip the bed onto its side again and attached the two mending plates to the top bunk. Make sure they’re centred! Carefully flip the beds, now attached on only one side so they’re a bit fragile. When you turn them over you’ll likely notice that things aren’t lining up just right. Don’t worry! The final screws will fix them. On the left you can see how the posts are before the last two mending plates are attached. Just gently press them into place beforehand. You’ll find the attachments are very sturdy, and because the mending plates are attached on the interior they don’t detract from the overall appearance of the bunk beds. Now all you have to do is replace the bedding… And last but not least, insert happy cats!

{"title": "How to add light to poorly lit bathroom vanity mirror", "content": "The house we’re renting at the moment has a very poorly lit en suite. It’s served by two tiny energy saving bulbs which take far too long to warm up, and they’re set so far back from the mirror that the only thing you can ever see is your silhouette. IKEA hack to the rescue! The idea was to use a picture frame, hanging from the top edge of the mirror, and filled with LEDs. The picture frame hold the vanity lights to shine on the bathroom mirror. This would put the light where it needs to be, be easily adjusted or removed, and allow for the wiring to be tucked behind the mirror’s edge for a clean look. There were two ways to fix the lights. 1. Forward facing is the most traditional and throws out the most light, but it would make the frame bulkier. 2. Side firing lights would look sleeker, but would sacrifice functionality. I had to test the output. Light facing forward Side firing Thankfully, enough light is reflected off of the mirror to provide good illumination, and the side firing setup is the winner going forward! Discarding the transparent, card sheet, and backing layers of the MOSSEBO left me with the frame, the cardboard spacer, and enough of a cavity to just fit the DIODER strips! Then it was just a matter of extending the daisy-chain connectors slightly to evenly space the lights with just one power wire out. I used some of the ample spare wire, my soldering iron, and some tiny heat-shrink tubing I had lying around. Next I removed some material from one corner of the frame spacer to allow room for the power wire, and a groove to the centre top. A couple of staples into the wooden frame are more than enough to allow the wire to take the weight. On my first try I used a staple gun, and ended up crushing the wire with the staples! These wires are pretty soft, but a second go with an office stapler worked a charm. Go softly, but remember there’s three spare lengths of wire! To hang the frame from the mirror, I ended up utilising one of the metal clips which came with the DIODER. I cut the plug off the base-end of the power wire and fed it through the centre hole with the intention of tying a knot on the other side, but simply tucking the wire under provided more than enough friction to hold it. To keep the frame from tilting, you can use the double-sided foam tape which comes with the DIODER to stick the top edge to the mirror. It’s invisible, easily removable, and cleans up completely with a bit of glass cleaner. The last part was to simply tuck the remaining wire behind the edge of the mirror top, then down the gap along the wall to the power socket. To trim the unnecessary wiring, I cut the plug off the power adapter and joined it directly to the power wire from the frame (AFTER feeding it through the hanging clip!). This bypasses the 4-way adapter box and the thicker run of wire with the in-line switch. It’s FAR tidier now. To completely hide the lights and joining wires, you can stick some thin paper (or preferably tracing paper/mylar) to the inside faces of the frame. With the lights off it just looks like a smooth white frame.

{"title": "Seamless, integrated MALM drawers for walk-in closet", "content": "I decided to use the MALM chest of 4 drawers as the solution to an integrated drawer in a . The MALM’s minimalistic and flat frontage made it a great choice for a project like this. It was much simpler and cheaper to hack the MALM unit than build something bespoke. 1.1. Install MDF on either side of the unit to meet the top piece. This will act as the edge of the unit that will be integrated with the MALM drawers. The closet space – before 1.2. Create a sturdy frame in 3”x2” timber, the same size as the footprint of the MALM unit, and attach the bottom. This should raise the MALM unit from the floor enough for the skirting to pass seamlessly. (You may need to raise higher depending on the size of skirting board used in your room.) Studwork in, starting to plasterboard and the MALM unit fitted 1.3 Lightly sand the drawer fronts and any other front-facing elements of the MALM unit. 1.4. Paint the drawer fronts and other front-facing elements of the unit with a suitable undercoat. 2.1. Build stud walls using 3″x2″ timber. Ensure you leave enough room for your door casing for the door to hang within. (For my project, as I was using the VIKEDAL flush-mount door, this was simply a case of leaving a gap the width of the door). 2.2. Whilst building the stud wall, build in the MALM unit (as prepared earlier) and fit the stud-work to the top and sides of the unit. (This will make it really sturdy). Note that you will need to ensure that the MALM unit protrudes exactly as much as the plasterboard so that you can get a flush look. Also check that the drawers still run freely and the unit remains square. 2.3 Once the studwork is all installed, run any cabling that you require (for lighting or power supply. Consult an electrician if necessary). 2.4 Install plasterboard on both sides of the stud wall. Plasterboard completed. (You can also see the “z” brackets for the false door) 2.5. Install the door casing for the entrance to the closet. 2.6. Tape all joints of the plasterboard, including taping around edges of the MALM unit (I used “Wet n Stick” self adhesive paper tape – it’s more expensive but much easier for novices) Plasterboard filled, sanded and base coat applied 2.7 Skim over the tape and screw holes of the plasterboard with dry wall filler, also known as “fine-fill”. This should take at least two coats, but you may choose to do more after sanding depending on the finish. (Multiple thin coats will get a much better result than thick coats.) Plasterboarded plus skirting board fitted 2.8 Once fully dried, sand the filler using fine sandpaper. (No harsher than grade 120 grit.) 2.9 Repeat 2.7 and 2.8 as necessary until you are happy with the finish. Pay particular attention to where the MALM unit meets the plasterboard – you want this to be seamless. 2.10 Paint the whole thing (walls, MALM unit and MALM drawers) in desired finish. It’ll need to be a tough paint as you will need to do the drawers and walls in the same finish to get a seamless result. (I used due to its hardiness). Close up of the integrated MALM drawers 2.11 Connect / install any lighting or power sockets as appropriate (using an electrician if necessary). 2.12 Hang the VIKEDAL door to the door casing using the standard hinges. 2.13 With the second VIKEDAL, install “Z” hanging brackets to the rear and wall, and align with the Vikedal door. This should then look like two doors, but only one opens in to the closet. All done! 2.14 You can then install rails, shelving, etc inside the . (We maximised space by running them down each side, which is why we needed to only have one opening door). Points 2.3 and 2.11 are optional depending on your circumstances and may require expert help from an electrician. In total it took approximately 4 days to complete the entire project but that includes the wider walk-in closet and the need for drying times (between coats of filler) Cost of MALM unit (with Family discount) £40 and VIKEDAL doors including hinges £90. Overall cost of building materials (for entire creation of the walk-in closet, including internal shelving and rails, c.£100) Ensuring the drawers and plasterboard / filling are perfectly flush. If they are even 1mm off then this could impact the overall look as you’d see the join. You need to ensure the carcass of the MALM unit is firmly fixed in place to allow no movement when operating the drawers. When fixing in place you also need to ensure it remains true and square so that the drawers continue to line up and fit properly. Seriously, I’m not sure I would. I took a long time planning it and am very pleased with the result. I would have liked to have completed it sooner. (We had a 5-month gap between starting and finishing the project due to a serious cycle accident at the start of the year, just as I’d started to build it!)

If I push them all together the total width of the bookcases will measure 370 cm. However, the length of my wall is 384 cm. So, I placed them slightly distanced from each other so the bookcases can span wall to wall. I made sure the spacing of the gaps were consistent between bookcases. I also slotted the smaller HEMNES bookcases between the larger ones for symmetry. After getting the placements right, I made the first cut. I sawed off the legs by a few centimeters so it would fit with the baseboard which is 95 mm high. With the IKEA HEMNES bookcases in position, I added the baseboard to the front. They were starting to look built-in already! Then, I used crown moulding on top, spanning the entire length of the IKEA HEMNES bookshelves, to make them look like one big built-in bookcase. And finally, I used my and to make 6 pieces of trim to cover the gaps between the bookcases. After the routing was done, I sanded the wood down and cleaned off the saw dust. Then, I primed and painted the front of the trim pieces white to match the HEMNES bookcase. The last step was to fix the trim onto the HEMNES bookcases. And that’s was it, I finished the IKEA HEMNES built-in bookcase. I’m thinking of adding some nice lamps on top of the bookcase. But at the moment, I can’t decide on one that I like. Any suggestions?

But I didn’t like the attachment kit that came with the cabinets. They were 2 brackets for hooking them together at the back and a strip of double-sided tape for the front (pix, below). My method replaces the two steps (pictured below) which uses the stacking bracket and tape from the BESTÅ frame assembly manual. Stacking BESTÅ cabinets – Page 21 & 21 of IKEA Assembly Manual Since I had some BESTÅ cabinets which were going to be wall-mounted and didn’t need their bottom planks with the leg-holes in them, I took those to put on the top of each of the stacked cabinets. I bought some 8x50mm screws. I took out the inserts for the legs in what would be the top of the cabinet. Then I placed that plank on a scrap plank I had lying around so that I could drill through the holes. I wanted to just barely pierce the other side. This was so that I knew where to drill through from the other side to make sure the hole was cleanly made without tearing the film. Then I was able to stack them and pass the screws through the top plank of the bottom cabinet. Next, I screwed them into the normal bottom of the top cabinet. In the end, I had easily aligned all of my cabinets and secured them together with very little effort. This is the result. (It’s part of a larger project which isn’t done yet).

{"title": "How to add PAX sliding doors on your own woodwork", "content": "This project started when I wanted to replace a coat rack and garden seat with a closet. I decided to build my own wood frame but use the IKEA PAX sliding doors over it. In a corner of the hallway, I decided to replace the coat rack and garden seat (not shown) with a cupboard using IKEA PAX sliding doors. The space is +/-1650 x 560mm. 1. The top IKEA rail fixes on top of their PAX cupboards and is about 10mm longer than the inside measurement (1500-18-18mm). To fit it inside my woodwork, I cut 5mm off each end. 2. As standard, the right-hand door is on the inside. To be difficult, I wanted the left-hand door to be the the inside one. This is perfectly OK* – just be careful when fitting the stick-on brushes, etc. (pages 18, 26 & 32 of the IKEA document). *If you are fitting the soft closing devices, note that the finger bracket (Komplement document, page 10) for the outside door is not reversible, so when 1 door is fully open, you lose about 8cm passage width, compared with the standard arrangement. Maybe one day, I will fix that! ( ) 3. End stops/bumpers (Komplement document, page 4): I used the original ones and just cut off the clips which hold the door in its closed position (these clips are not necessary with the soft closing devices). 1. Choose planed timber for the frames, keeping in mind the height of any other doors nearby (living room door in my case). I used 30x90mm timber for the floor (gives a good height for the lower rail in my case). These were fixed to the floor tiles with adhesive, screws and plugs. Be careful when drilling in the tiles, and don’t hit any pipes, etc.! I used 45×45 timber for the walls. 2. As I am not using the , the top rail fits on the lower edge of the MDF panel above the doors. The dimension (height) of this panel above the floor frame is 1930mm. If you are patient, you can confirm this by assembling one edge of a door and measuring all the bits. In my case, I went to the local IKEA store with my tape measure! This distance is critical: less means that the guides on the lower edge of the doors risk jumping out of the rail, more means that these guides will bind (in this case, you could shim the lower rail). 3. I drilled 7 holes in the top rail, and used 4×60 chipboard screws to attach it to the upper panel. It was easier to prepare this before fitting the panel in place. In the photo, the panel is flipped and held conveniently in place for this operation by the new woodwork. 4. The front and side panels are 18mm MDF. When fixing the timber on the walls, I allowed for the thickness of the panels beside the living room door frame and on the right-hand side (to align with the existing wall). The side panel was fitted first, then the upper front panel (adjusted for height), then the left-hand filler panel. 5. The filler panel to the left of the sliding doors was adjusted to give +/- 1500mm from the right-hand edge to the groove in the filler panel. This groove is to accommodate the IKEA edge profile. I used a for the groove. In my case, this measurement is 1491mm, which gave a good closing position for the doors, relative to the edge profiles. 6. Fitting the mirrors into the door metalwork was not going well, until I used a ratchet cargo strap to squeeze the bits together (both ways, X & Y) so that the screw holes lined up. Not sure if even 2 people (IKEA minimum requirement) could do this without the strap! 7. For the edging of the doors (brush and flexible flap), in my case, the brush went on the left-hand edge of the left-hand/inside door and the flap was fixed on the right-hand edge of the right-hand/outside door (not like in the IKEA instructions!). On the top rail, I fitted a 1m strip of 24V leds, turned on by Legrand furniture door switches, which are operated by the fingers of the soft closing devices. The 24VDC supply is in the connection box. An interesting hack here would be to incorporate the light switches in the soft closing devices. It’s not obvious how these things come apart. Maybe someone will invest in a set and play about! I added some shelves behind the filler panel, and there was a nice space for the modem below. As I didn’t want to use the 235cm door and didn’t want to add swing doors in the upper panel, I fitted a half-depth top shelf, under which is the coat rail. ~ by Richard King, Belgium", "author": "Jules Yap", "date": "2019-08-05T10:00:31-04:00", "url": "https://ikeahackers.net/2019/08/add-pax-sliding-doors-woodwork.html", "categories": ["ikea-hacks"], "tags": ["ikea", "hack", "diy"], "image_url": "https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pax-sliding-doors-hack.jpg", "excerpt": "This project started when I wanted to replace a coat rack and garden seat with a closet.

{"title": "Popular IKEA coffee table takes on the world (map)", "content": "I had seen a glass-top table made on an advertising campaign (for a stationers) and thought a LACK coffee table was the perfect candidate. Plus I had seen a back-lit world map wall mounted in an office and thought it was a good first subject to put under the glass. Here’s the finished result. And with lights! I found an outline world map on the web, and printed it to the proper scale, and taped the sheets together. Then, glued it to the MDF sheet and used my scroll saw to cut it out. A bit of sanding and all the continents and islands were ready for their paint job. I had to obviously not use some of the smaller islands, and also combine some island ranges into one piece of mdf. Still, islands like Ireland and Tasmania proved to be very small. For the supports for each piece of MDF I started to hand-saw 2cm lengths of dowel, but very quickly realised I would get a much better and quicker result by using my bandsaw. I knew IKEA tables had solid corners to support the legs, but thin top and bottom pieces sandwiching a card/paper honeycomb pattern. I scored the underside of the table, then pried the bottom bit of hardboard away. Then, I had some assistance to remove the cardboard and leave a hollow base. On the top side I marked the holes for the glass table top stand-offs (using the glass itself as a guide) then secured the stand-offs. When I was deciding the placement of the stand-offs, I deliberately put them in the corners, so there is good purchase from the long screws, in to the corner blocks that support the legs. For the two middle stand-offs, I glued some old scrap blocks in between the table top’s thin surfaces to give it more security. I laid out the world map on the table top, and drew around them. Then, marked where I wanted the dowels to site. I glued them in and once dry, I then marked the locations of the LEDs. I originally figured I’d need about 70 lights. But got carried away adding them and when I counted them up realised I had about 160! Luckily I had ordered 2 sets of the (thinking that I’d perhaps make another table after this one). I realised therefore that I could just wire them together to give me enough bulbs. I drilled all the holes from the top, to give the cleanest finish. And then pushed the LEDs in from underneath and secured them with my hot glue gun. I made sure I kept testing the lights, as I did not want to get to the end to find them no longer working. The final assembly was following the IKEA instructions to complete assembly of the legs and lower shelf, then gluing the (now painted) land masses to the dowels. Finally, the glass was secured to the table using the chrome screw tops of the 6 stand offs. And that completes my back-lit world map coffee table. It took me a weekend’s work and less than £100. What I like most is the back-lit world map looks stunning in a dim room. The hardest part about this hack was drilling the 170 odd holes for the LEDs. Mounting the battery pack to ensure it can be “seen” by the remote control and that you can unclip the cover to change batteries. 1. The dowels were 2 cm long, too long in this case (too easy to see some of the bulbs underneath). I would halve this next time, as this was still plenty to clear the LED bulbs. 2. I’d work out the alignment of the land masses better and not use hot glue to secure them, simply because there isn’t the time/scope to re-adjust before the glue cools and goes hard enough to prevent fine adjustment. 3. I’d use fewer dowels, and even smaller (narrower) ones to avoid them being seen.

{"title": "3D Printer Workbench with fold away desk", "content": "I have a small room, but want to be able to do various project work, including working on my 3D printer. And I really wanted a desk where I can have things organized or I spend all my time looking for my tools and pieces. So, I used an IKEA HEMNES console table, two HEMNES night stands, and the top part of the two-part HEMNES writing desk (the desk add-on unit). The two night stands are placed on top of the console table, and the add on unit on top of them, like the cross slab of a megalith, done in wood plank furniture. At first, I piled the HEMNES units up. The problem with this set up is there isn’t all that much table space for basic computing work. Like having space for a monitor and keyboard. The solution was to replace the top plate of the console table with a wider one, then attach the narrower original plate with hinges to the wider plate. Much like a secretary desk. I got a board cut to size, 2 cm thick, which I then proceeded to sand all the edges off and hand-painted several layers of white, trying to get the same white stained finish as the HEMNES. After that, the tricky part was replicating the holes of the top plate accurately – 6 large and 4 small – on the new board.  Just measuring them would not cut it, at least not in my experience with similar projects earlier. I needed some sort of marker I could use to derive the drilling spots from the console table itself. Then, I realised pencils could do the job. A regular pencil fit the smaller holes nicely. For the larger holes, I used Faber-Castell large coloring pencils. Related: After marking all the necessary holes, the moment of truth! Using a and the distance-stop on the drill, I first did a test drill in a piece of left-over wood of the same thickness, then drilled the larger holes first. Of the 6 big holes, 2 needed a tiny bit of sideways drilling to go in. The four smaller holes just fit perfectly. Quite amazing. In order to prevent the overhanging board from bending and breaking over time, I added support brackets underneath. The last part was adding the foldable table top with foldable legs. This also needs to be done carefully, which . Poorly placed hinges can make proper folding impossible, or at least break down quickly. I also used some magnets to hold up the legs in the folded position. Since part of the reason for this workbench is that I get to have my tools organized, I got some Skådis hook plates and a bunch of attachments. I put two plates hinge-mounted in front, leaving me with space to hang my tools. The 3D printer workbench folds down nicely to allow an air mattress, and up to work on. The legs are admittedly a bit unstable. But it’s a huge step up from a wobbly folding table and a flimsy metal shelf system. The main part, after putting together the IKEA parts and painting the board, took about a week. Above the IKEA parts, it cost maybe €70 total, I didn’t count. I was lucky that the space between the chests of drawers was large enough, I didn’t measure that. A different printer might be too large. I needlessly cut out spaces for hinges on the board, thinking I wanted the foldable part to fold upwards. Folding downwards is much easier.

We quite fancied getting a wash basin instead of the traditional sink and vanity but couldn’t source a suitable washstand. It just so happened that we had two kitchen carts lying around unused. So, I put my thinking cap on and came up with this hack. Each cart has two longer legs and two shorter ones with casters. The height of the short legs turned out to be perfect so I bolted all four of them on to one of the carts. And kept the longer ones for a different project. (Alternatively, if you don’t have 2 carts, you can cut the longer legs to length of the shorter ones) The next step was to cut away and reinforce the upper shelf to accommodate the plumbing. Quite simple after a bit of measuring and the removed bars were cut down to use as crosspieces. After some thought, I decided to add a drawer. So I picked up a set of slides at the local DIY shop. I used the front panel from the second cart as a drawer front and sourced a couple of small boxes from a dollar store to build the drawer. A thin sheet of plywood on the underside of the two boxes gives the drawer rigidity. The space between is to make room for the sink drainpipe.

Usually the work has to do with early 20th century modernism, using references to the or Constructivism, but framed through a contemporary consumerist context. In fact, my work was recently included in the at the IKEA Museum in Älmhult. So I got a chance to go there! Here are a few IKEA projects I have worked on over the years. The most recent sculpture is the IKEA Skeleton. I buy a lot of IKEA and end up with lots of leftover material. So I had the idea to see if I could make a skeleton with the parts I had. Well … hello? The challenge is to use the IKEA product with as little alteration as possible. It would be a lot easier to sculpt a skeleton using common raw materials like wood or clay. But, I wanted to be constrained by what was available and I wanted the result to be recognisably IKEA. The problem-solving process is what keeps me interested. I had so much fun making it that I started another one, which will be made of different parts. My project is titled INGVAR_1, and it’s a life-size articulated skeleton made of 100% IKEA parts. I know this isn’t really the usual kind of hack on because it’s a sculpture rather than a useful object. But, you guys may be interested to see it.  It would be very difficult to list all the items that went into it, and instructions would be impossible. INGVAR is of course the name of the late founder of IKEA. I made this as a respectful commemoration. This is from an exhibition called Catalog, which consists of 5 sculptures. I made the Catalog (Blue Tables) from tables. Firstly, I cut and then, reassembled each table. In addition, each table has motorized legs that tilts the table gently up and down. The result is a wave-like motion. . This is the first in a series of sculpture/furniture pieces that are based on the architecture of Walter Gropius, the founder of the Bauhaus.

It’s an IKEA kitchen do-over with plywood cabinet fronts. I bought an apartment and it came with a brand new . Problem is, I’m not very fond of wall cabinets and tall cabinets for refrigerator, etc. I find it more suitable to have all cabinets on one level. Another issue with the existing kitchen was the size of the / island. It was too small. So I decided to re-do the kitchen with a new layout and custom cabinet fronts. I ripped the kitchen down, keeping the IKEA METOD base cabinets. The tall cabinets were cut in half. 🙂 The top half of the tall cabinets became too flimsy after the cut, and I was not able to reuse them. Since the kitchen is in an open space with my living room, I wanted the kitchen to blend in as much as possible. I think when all the cabinets are at the same level and by omitting the typical kitchen wall cabinets above the countertop, you remove the kitchen feeling. In the meantime, the new setup was drawn up. It featured a larger kitchen peninsular, including seating for 4 and the integration of a small IKEA freezer and refrigerator. When the drawing was finalised, it was time to get it personalised. As with my other , I chose the same deco blue color to match the . Instead of stock IKEA doors, I went with custom made birch plywood fronts and self-designed brass handles. I drew up a suggestion and went to an iron worker, who bent them according to my specifications. Experimenting with kitchen handles is not as straight forward as it seems. After mounting the brass handles, which were made in the same length as the doors, I soon discovered it was not possible to open the doors to the right or left ;). I got into a real spin trying to find a solution. My intention was to keep the brass handles in one straight line. After some thinking I came up with an idea to not use side hinges at all. I used the front of a spare drawer as a template to drill holes at the back of the new plywood fronts. Then I placed a big drawer in every cabinet on the lower section and used drawer hinges to mount the door to the drawer. Now the fronts slide straight out instead of swinging open to the right or left. It’s important to buy the big drawer as it has an extra metal rod to stabilize the front to the drawer. And best of all, it works great! All of the custom drawer fronts are made from birch plywood at a thickness of 18mm thick. The drawer fronts are treated with decor wax to keep them from turning yellow and makes them easy to clean. (Becomes water resistant) I bought the plywood boards from local retailer and brought them to a local carpenter who has a CNC cutter.

{"title": "Toilettes de Chat Royale (Extravagant cat litter box furniture)", "content": "I was inspired by to build my own variant of their deluxe cat litter box furniture solution … 1. Being attractive enough to be in the living space, 2. Having top entry to allow gravity to work to keep litter inside, and 3. Having horizontal elements to allow cat litter mats to trap litter as they walk across them, 1. Needing space for 2 litter boxes with lids (to contain litter and pee inside the boxes), 2. Both the cabinet interior and the boxes themselves needed to be easy to clean. The elaborate design I came up with has 2 “floors” made of fully extendable MAXIMERA drawers, and a lift top. This makes it much easier to reach the litter boxes, remove their lids, and scoop, and makes the cabinet interior more accessible for vacuuming. (Purchased for project:) IKEA materials: ~$650 Non-IKEA materials: ~$250 (Additional) tools investment: ~$100 ~$1000 My litter boxes (including lids) were 22″d x 16.5″w x 18.5″h, and 19″d x 14.5″w x 17″h, respectively. I couldn’t find any other IKEA cabinets which would be deep enough to hold either of them. So I decided to use SEKTION 24″ base cabinets and create a two-floor system within them. I measured to ensure everything would fit, and figured out where I needed to install the drawers and the shelf to provide the cats’ interior access. (The smaller box would go on the “upper floor,” and the larger one at the bottom.) I traced out and made my first set of cuts on the interior wall of the first cabinet using a hand-held jigsaw. I also traced out and cut a hole in the back of the first drawer bottom to allow access to the lower level of the cabinet system. After this, I assembled the first cabinet mostly as per IKEA instructions although without any worktop or wall mounting. I didn’t bother with nailing the thin back panels in place, and this turned out to be a good decision. That was because I was adding an exterior back anyway. And, because I later realized I had incorrectly installed the panels white-side out, which would have been impossible to fix had I nailed them in. I then installed the “upper floor” drawer with the cut-out in its bottom. ( Even though I measured, it turned out I was able to raise the drawer rails here one inch higher, allowing me to eventually enlarge the lower level entry hole. This proved necessary to provide sufficient access to the box on the other side of the cabinet for my bigger cat. YMMV…) I used the cut side panel to template and make the cuts on the second interior panel. I then assembled the second cabinet, screwed the two cabinets together using 1 1/4″ countersink screws, and installed the “entry” shelf. (lesson learned): Use clamps when screwing the cabinets together, and pay special attention to ensuring the cabinets are aligned on both the front and back. This is important for getting both flush front doors and a flush cabinet back, which, in turn, was especially important later for hinge alignment when mounting the lid. Next, I assembled and installed the other MAXIMERA low drawer at the very bottom of the second cabinet, and then moved on to the doors. I assembled and hung the first set of doors as per IKEA instructions. Installing the second pair of doors proved to be one of the trickier parts of the hack. The lower drawer needed to be at the very bottom of its cabinet in order to provide enough clearance below the entry shelf for the lower litter box’s lid. But IKEA doors are mortised to place the hinges in the same holes in the SEKTION cabinet as the drawer rails use when installed in that lowest position. So I had to cut new hinge mortises in the bottoms of the doors to raise where the lower hinges would be mounted. UTRUSTA hinges use a 35mm primary mortise hole, and 9mm holes for the two smaller hinge pins. I used a for the main mortise, but since 9mm drill bits are not common in the U.S., I used a 5/16″ (~7.9mm) drill bit for the smaller holes and then my to widen those holes to ~9mm. I measured from the door edge to the center of the mortise to match next mounting point in the SEKTION cabinet at 6.25″, and the depth from the edge of the door at 7/8″. Then I used some of the very thin paper that came with some of the IKEA packaging to trace out and align the smaller holes to the larger mortise. After remortising and mounting the doors on the repositioned hinges, I attached the ENERYDA handles as per package instructions. (In the pics below, my unfinished plywood top is just resting on the cabinet.) Next, I temporarily removed the shelf, tipped the cabinet on its side, and installed the EKET adjustable feet on the bottom, to allow the cabinet to be leveled, and provide clearance for the doors to swing open without scraping the floor. This step probably can be done earlier, and in fact, I had to do it before I could properly finish adjusting/aligning all the doors, as my floors proved uneven and were warping the cabinet frame until I leveled it. (Also note: the shot below was taken after I had properly attached the outer back, using the feet as clamping points.) Because I wanted a lift top, I had to add a more substantial back to the cabinet which could support the hinges and the lid. For this, I used two inexpensive 24″ white HÄGGEBY door panels. I aligned their exterior edges to be flush with the edges of the cabinet. This left a small gap between them in the middle (shown in pix below), but I didn’t mind that, as the unit would still be against a wall. To attach the panels to the cabinet, I used 2 SEKTION Kitchen Island assembly kits to get solid mounting points and brackets for securing the doors to the cabinet from the inside. I cut and installed the presswood planks from the kit as instructed, placing one plank at the top and bottom of the back of each cabinet. Although one kit would have provided all the plank material necessary, I needed two kits to provide me with enough brackets to attach at both the top and bottom of each door on each side (8 in total). I put 3 additional screws through the top plank into each door panel to ensure good connection to the back below the hinges. And I used longer (1″) screws to attach the bottom of the doors through the brackets to the frame. (As there are no cutouts in the interior back at the bottom, and the combined material was too thick to get enough get a good bite into the doors with the provided screws.) As mentioned earlier, I also ended up clamping the door panel bottoms to the back using the feet installed above before screwing the panels into place, to force good contact and ensure a secure connection. (The shot below was taken after I attached the hinges, but before I had taken this extra step, and you can see the gap along the side that I needed to fix.) Making the lift top turned out to be the hardest part of the project. I wanted a wooden top, but unfortunately EKBY natural finish shelves are no longer sold in the U.S. And the various butcher block solutions available through IKEA were all too thick, heavy, and expensive for my purposes. So I had a 25×50″ piece cut from a sheet of carpentry-grade red oak plywood. Then I cut the entry hole in the top using my new 3/4″ Forstner bit to get rounded corners, and the to connect these “pilot holes.” I cut from the top side of the board so that any plywood damage wouldn’t be too visible. But I learned: when drilling through plywood, clamp another piece of scrap plywood below the work piece. This way you won’t get “chip out” as you punch through. (I had to use wood filler and glue to repair some damaged plywood veneer on the bottom of the lid because I failed to do this.) To finish the top, I sanded the entry hole cuts to make the edges clean and smooth. I used wood filler to repair any remaining surface defects along the plywood edges. Then, I applied 13/16″ red oak pre-glued, iron-on edge banding to the outer and entry-hole plywood edges to make it look like a solid wood panel. I ironed in ~1′ sections as I worked my way around the piece, using a veneer roller on each section after ironing it to ensure good even glue contact. Then, I carefully trimmed the excess material with a utility knife, placing each edge on a scrap piece of plywood to provide backing support as I cut. Next, I sanded, pre-stained, stained, and polyurethaned the piece as per the manufacturer’s instructions for each finishing step. With all the steps and drying time, it took several days to complete the work. To mount the lid, I went “all out” and installed 4 rather expensive . I’m sure other solutions might have worked. But the beauty of torsion hinges is that they keep the lid at whatever angle you let go of it. They require no separate props to hold it open. They also effectively provide a “soft close” and there are no side mounts to deal with. So, to me, it just seemed like the best way to go. (Rockler sells these hinges in various strengths to support different size lids. They also provide a calculator to help you get the ones you need.) However, it turned out that the hinges were meant for a panel slightly wider than the HÄGGEBY doors. To solve this problem, I made 4 small shims of “plywood” from the iron-on edge banding I had purchased for the top. I cut 5 “plywood layers” of banding to size for each hinge. Stacked three layers facing one way and two facing the other, so that all the glue would be inside the resulting piece. I then ironed them together. Rolling each with the veneer roller to ensure thorough glue contact and a resulting strong, flat piece of very thin plywood. These were a snap to make. And they proved to be perfect for ensuring that the hinges were mounted squarely to the door panels without any gap. I placed them between the inside of the panels and the bottom of the hinges. Marked and drilled the pilot holes, and then screwed the hinges into place with the provided screws. Once the cabinet back and hinges were properly attached, I laid the unit on its side. I raised it up with leftover plywood to slide the lid under the hinges. Then, marked and carefully drilled shallow pilot holes on the lid, before attaching the lid to the hinges using the provided screws. (Having the back panels be flush with each other at this point was essential.) Et Voilà! Although more expensive than I had hoped, the finished cabinet works really well. It saves my back and knees when cleaning it, and my cats are happy with it so far. (I didn’t add stairs to the side, as they can easily jump up onto the cabinet. These can be added later, as necessary, when they get too old to make the leap.) I completed the project over roughly 3 weekends. If I had it to do over again, I would make the top 26″ or even 27″ deep. This would allow for the (unaccounted-for) added width of the HÄGGEBY back panels, and allow for more of an overhang over both the doors and the hinges. Also, I might choose 30″ cabinets and drawers vs. 24″. The extra space would allow me to put the cat litter refill box inside the cabinet itself as well, and allow more horizontal space for trapping litter. On the other hand, a larger cabinet would require a larger spot along the wall and a longer top. The latter would then likely exceeded the maximum weight limit for the torsion hinges, so I would then have to sacrifice the lift top. ~ by Will Sadkin", "author": "Jules Yap", "date": "2019-04-09T10:05:20-04:00", "url": "https://ikeahackers.net/2019/04/cat-litter-box-furniture-ikea-sektion.html", "categories": ["ikea-hacks"], "tags": ["ikea", "hack", "diy"], "image_url": "https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/double-cat-litter-10-768x432.jpg", "excerpt": "I was inspired by to build my own variant of their deluxe cat litter box furniture solution … 1.

Then I used my skills from modelling for Google Earth 3D buildings to draw a model in the free SketchUp programme (formerly Google SketchUp). This application measures the pieces automatically, so I ordered the needed particle boards according to it. I then asked a carpenter to edge them with black color. The design idea was to use the dividing black shelves between the EKET boxes with shorter depth (about 3 cm). The building of the bookcase itself was easy by screwing the EKET boxes on the back (behind their bottom) with the horizontal black wooden shelves. The small vertical dividers I left without any fixing them to the boxes. On the higher levels I used the attached wall mounting kit to fix the EKETs to the wall. The most time consuming operation was to build the 42 cubes. To build the cubes and shelves together took me about one afternoon.

I used the IKEA LACK wall shelves as the base to install shelves and then hid lights behind them. This tutorial is also great if you just want to install floating wall shelves of any length. 1. First, determine the length of the valance lighting to be created and select a corresponding number of LACK wall shelves. In the case shown here, we used three IKEA LACK wall shelves with a length of 110 cm each. The LACK shelves do not have to completely fill the entire length of the newly emerging valance light. Gaps are allowed and sometimes even useful. 2. After determining the height of the lighting, it starts already. Mount the brackets of the LACK wall shelves on the wall. Use a to make sure they align to each other. 3. After mounting the brackets, push the LACK shelves in and locked them in with screws. 4. Then, cover the LACK wall shelves with plasterboard.

On the top panel, this is not necessary and in the front, the screws tighten very well. The front panel is designed as the valance lighting panel. In order to have an indirect valance lighting situation, we made the front panel a few centimetres wider than the LACK shelves. 5. In addition, we glued a stucco profile to the front. That initially creates a gap between the profile and gypsum board which is not tragic. The entire construction is later filled and sanded. 6. Depending on personal preferences, you can further outfit the new valance lighting to suit your room decor. Here, you can choose whether you prefer a modern style or classic with stucco profiles. The limit is your imagination only. We used this valance lighting above our mirror as seen here. 7. Finally, wire up the strip lights to get your valance lighting. It is a very cheap und useful hack.

In total, we spent $325, which was far cheaper than buying a custom made to fit the space. The first thing I did was decide how big I wanted the desk. I used the 29.5 x 61″ table top from IKEA whole, and cut the 2nd piece for the “L” with the circular saw with a guide to create a straight cut. I made that piece 18 x 34″ so that it would fit where we were going to use the desk. There are metal braces on the bottom of the table tops. Remove them before cutting, and make sure that you cut the table top so that the finished side of the desk will point outward, otherwise you’ll have the hole for the metal bracket channel facing out. Upsize LINNMON table tops into a I brought the pieces into the office where the desk was going to reside and started assembling. First, I used one metal brackets to brace the 2 pieces together, and then used the 1 x 4″ wood to trim around it and added more metal brackets for extra stability. Since we have baseboard heat, and I wanted the desk to sit flush against the wall, I offset the rear facing 1×4 so that the legs could be bolted to it far enough away to clear the baseboard heater. Once I secured the 1 x 4 wood around the the table tops (with 2 pieces in the center of the 29.5 x 61 piece for the keyboard tray to mount to), we flipped the desk over onto 2 saw horses. I screwed the legs into the desk and then removed the saw horses. After that I stained the desk and installed a couple for power and monitor wires. My only advice would be to measure twice, cut once. In my books, the IKEA corner table project went well and I ended up with the desk I wanted. And it fits the room to a tee. I even ended up using a scrap piece to make a small for another room which is secured to the wall with fold away shelf brackets. ~ by Peter", "author": "Jules Yap", "date": "2019-02-28T09:56:16-05:00", "url": "https://ikeahackers.net/2019/02/ikea-corner-table-diy.html", "categories": ["ikea-hacks"], "tags": ["ikea", "hack", "diy"], "image_url": "https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IKEA-corner-table-1-768x576.jpg", "excerpt": "Here’s how I made a large IKEA corner table from their work tops and legs.

They have a comfortable height for getting in and out of bed and can be easily combined due to the variety of modules. This is the first sketch I did when I had the idea for this waterbed frame. It did not include the four wooden boards to support the weight. But, I was not sure if the KALLAX shelves where strong enough to carry a waterbed. So I placed four wooden boards between the shelves. I used some and to connect the shelves To support the main weight, I used eight legs, that held up an Oriented Strand Board, that exactly fitted between the shelves The waterbed base was finished. Time to do something for the optics. I bought two MDF boards that when combined were a bit larger than the base. The reason, I had bought two boards and not one was a single board 150×200 cm would not fit into my car. I was not sure if I would need it, as no one ever would walk on the laminate boards. But I had enough impact sound insulation left over from the last conversion so I had it installed under the laminate boards. The laminate did not have to be laid floating and so I screwed it on to the MDF board. I sawed the aluminum profile, mitered and glued it with hot glue on to the MDF board. The aluminum profile is 4 x 4 cm, which left enough room, to stick an on the inner vertical side of the profile. Well, I thought this is it and the work is done… …but after looking at the bed for a while I thought a headboard was missing. Not much. Just a place to drop a book or smartphone or something like that I cut a short MOSSLANDA picture ledge in half and screwed the four ledges on the chipboard. The lower ledge was on the same height as the bed and the upper ledge at a height so that a book or tablet would not accidentally drop over the edge. Since the chipboard was cut to the correct size, I had to . The headboard was just placed between the wall and the bed and not fixed to either of it. The last step was to glue the to the bed.

{"title": "Dad does it! Hacks the most amazing princess castle bed", "content": "When my son was 4 years old, my wife and I needed to move him out of his convertible toddler bed to a “ ” so that our daughter could begin to use the former. He wasn’t excited about it, so I offered to build him a new bed that was “ ”, and the result was a success that made him very happy. Our daughter is no dummy though … as she approached her fourth birthday, she began asking for her own special “big girl bed”. And while our son had given us complete “creative control”, our daughter was a little more specific: “a fairy princess castle bed … preferably pink,” she said. This is the Fairy Princess Castle Bed we built for her: Watch my , including 3D model, time lapse of the assembly, and my daughter’s reaction to her Fairy Princess Castle Bed: This hack was so extensive that giving detailed step-by-step instructions would be a book in itself, so here’s a concise summary: The hack consists of 2 major sections (each of which is comprised of a separate Kura bed): 1. Use belt sander to strip preexisting lacquer off all Kura parts 2. Stain all wooden Kura parts 3. Cover mdf panels provided with the Kura with grey contact paper on one side. 4. Assemble Kura roughly according to IKEA’s conventional directions, but keep each of the 4 walls separate from one another. Only notable exception is to not include the upper rail to the side wall adjacent to the ladder – as this will be where “the bed” joins “the tower”. This will also require 2 2x4s (or alternatively 2 2x2s) to help support the back wall, which otherwise can’t be assembled independently of the others. 5. Create frames for the door and window using 2x4s and 2×2 respectively. 6. Construct the door from bed slats taken from the second Kura: Cut off the ends to create the proper height. Attach them together using rectangular dowels nailed to their back sides. Use hacksaw to cut metal bars to the width of the door, superglue metal button magnets on the front to look like rivets, and paint the bar/magnet pieces black. Once dry, attach to the bed slats. (Super gluing them didn’t hold well – I had better luck with drilling shallow holes into the slats, filling with construction adhesive, and then clamping the bars over them for 24 hours. Be sure to roughen the back side of the bars for maximum adhesion). Once door finished, attach to the frame via hinges. Optional: Attached pink wooden fairy to the door using the same drill hole-filled with adhesive approach. 7. Construct window shutters using square dowels and strips of “hobby wood”. Paint pink. Attach to window frame. 8. Use white mdf panels for the walls. (The ones I used were actually intended for whiteboards, so were smooth white on one side, and rough/unfinished on the other. The smooth white side replicated dry wall relatively well). Attached walls to the inside of each of the now-assembled Kura wall frames. 9. Cut to fit into the preexisting spaces in the front frame. (I used Wellington light grey panels from . Attach to the backside of the mdf panels using construction adhesive. 10. Create an inset for behind the ladder using the same general principles used in steps 8 and 9. 11. Cut, sand, and stain plain moulding to use inside the first floor of “the bed” to cover over seems This is the more difficult half to hack/construct. First, the tower consists of part of the second Kura bed tipped on its side (It doesn’t include the top rail – which can be used as 2×2’s anywhere else in the project). Also, the tipped Kura may not be structurally sound; I create a platform for the second floor of the tower using 2×4’s, 2×2’s, and plywood, which stood completely independently of the visible tower. 12. As with “the bed”, strip and stain all wooden Kura parts. 13. Also as with “the bed”, assemble the 4 walls using the 12 main edge pieces to the bed/tower. 14. Create a lower platform using plywood placed on top of spare bed slats. (This will go directly on the actual room’s floor when finished) 15. Create the upper platform using 2x4s for the vertical supports, 2x2s for the “beams”, and plywood for the floor. The plywood can be covered on one side with the white mdf panels to make a nice ceiling for the first floor. 16. Use a combination of 2×2’s and mdf panels to create a wall that will divide the first floor into 2 halves. The left half will become an alcove for the hide-away bookcase, and the right will become a “secret passage”. 17. Create the sliding platform for the bookcase. I used 2 2x4s attached to the lower platform, 2 2x4s attached to a horizontal 1×12 that acted as a shelf, linked together by industrial-strength, full extension drawer slides. (I used 32” ) 18. Use a combination of 2×4’s, 2×2’s, mdf panels, and to create the front and side walls in similar fashion to what was done for “the bed”. This should include swinging doors covered with stone panel that will act like hidden compartments for the bookcase and secret passage. The back wall of the tower will rest against the wall of the actual room and thus, can be left open as it was for “the bed”. 19. Build door and window shutters as done with “the bed”. 20. Use plain moulding to cover vertical seams inside the tower, and additional moulding around the top (I used nature-themed moulding). 21. Cut wooden laminate flooring to cover both the lower and upper platforms. (You do not need to worry about underlayment for this kind of usage) 22. Build a bookcase that will fit in the alcove and on top of the sliding platform built during step 17. (I would have preferred to use an IKEA bookcase – for example, a or – but there wasn’t one that was the appropriate size). Paint (or finish) bookcase. I also glued some thin strips of nature-themed moulding to the front to add some character. 23. The tower roof was the most elaborate and challenging step. To begin, create a frame that will firmly attach to the top of the tower and also provide a lip for the roof to sit in. (This way, the roof will stay on by virtue of its weight alone, and you won’t need to worry about separately securing the roof.) The roof is built from 4 triangular shaped mdf panels, joined together by pairs of angled wooden dowels that act as radial beams for a vaulted, pyramid shaped ceiling. (I lacked the tools to do create those “beams”, so this involved a lot of sanding and revisions.) For the roof, I used cedar siding (which I needed to recut and sand prior to painting pink). By this point, you should have 4-5 different pieces for “the bed” (4 walls +/- separate inset behind the ladder), slats for “the bed”, and ~12 different pieces for “the tower” (4 walls, 2 platforms, 2-4 vertical posts for upper platform, 1 inner vertical wall on first floor, bookcase, roof frame, roof). Time to put them all together. (The main assembly took me ~10 hours, separated across 2 days). Now install the lights, any miniature furniture (e.g. pillows, kids chair, toy box), and attach fake plants (I literally stapled them to the wood frame). Add mattress and bed tent. Woohoo – you’re finally done! Our daughter loves her Fairy Princess Castle bed. Took 10 months and ~400 hours. Total cost was about $2000-2500 US (I didn’t keep receipts). How much my daughter likes it. Getting the hidden bookcase to slide in and out of its alcove with enough ease that my daughter could easily do it herself. A Kura bed is not necessarily structurally stable if used on its side. Also, be 100% sure this monstrosity will fit into its destination room before you start! I would have spent less time on the shingled roof, which is literally not visible without a step stool. ~ by Eric Strong", "author": "Jules Yap", "date": "2019-01-11T10:09:18-05:00", "url": "https://ikeahackers.net/2019/01/fairy-princess-castle-bed-ikea-kura.html", "categories": ["ikea-hacks"], "tags": ["ikea", "hack", "diy"], "image_url": "https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Completed-hack-2-6-768x512.jpg", "excerpt": "When my son was 4 years old, my wife and I needed to move him out of his convertible toddler bed to a “ ” so that our daughter could begin to use the former.

We changed the boiler to a combi a while ago, so we no longer needed the airing cupboard. In its place, we wanted an IKEA PAX with sliding wardrobe doors. The old wardrobe was fully built-in with concrete blocks, render, plaster, architraves and folding doors. The doors were well past their prime and kept coming away from their guides. Installing IKEA’s PAX wardrobes presented two issues to overcome – width and height. I didn’t want to remove the end wall by the door as I was concerned it may de-stabilize the adjoining bathroom wall and the ceiling height was an inch or so lower than the PAX wardrobes. First, I narrowed the right-hand wardrobe carcass by 70mm and shortened both carcasses by 40mm in height. Then, I installed the bottom door guides/runners under the base-board. This meant the sliding wardrobe doors could be about 10mm closer to the floor which I think looks better. I won’t lie, it was a pain and took a fair bit of head-scratching, swearing, and so-on but the result looks like a custom-made-to-measure wardrobe. For £400. I didn’t attempt to narrow the sliding wardrobe doors but nobody has noticed. By taking the time to replicate the original fixing holes on the shortened panels it all fitted together as if it were straight out of the box. The small wall enclosing the right-hand side of the wardrobe was about 120mm short of the front of the PAX assemblies. So I framed it out to match the front of the forward sliding door. Then spent quite a while getting the corner beads for plaster aligned to the sliding door as best I could. Next, I gave it a quick skim with regular . The result is quite a neat shadow line between the two of about 1/2”.

My final comments would be that yes; you can shorten for PAX wardrobes (as long as the doors are not mirrors etc!).

{"title": "IKEA LACK Stencilled Accent Table for succulents", "content": "Hi, my name is Elyse and here’s an IKEA hack inspired by Nifty, on how to upcycle an IKEA LACK side table into a beautiful stenciled accent table complete with succulents. First, sand your with 120 grit sandpaper to ensure a smooth, even surface. Next, decide how big you want to make the cutout in the middle. Buy your succulents or other decorative plants in advance so you have a better idea of how big to make the square opening. Locate the center of your table using a T-square ruler. Make sure the T-square part of the ruler touches the edge of your table, so the line will be perfectly straight. Mark the middle of the ruler on the surface of the table and repeat the process on the adjacent side of the table. You will then know the center of the table. From the center, use the T-square ruler to draw four lines of the same length outwards towards each side of the table. Using those four lines and the T-square ruler, create a square. Now that you have your square marked out, tape down the T-square ruler so it doesn’t move and take a box cutter to start cutting your square. Keep going over the same edge until it feels as if the blade has cut through the table. Repeat this process until all four sides have been cut and the square can be removed from the table. The material inside of the LACK table is like cardboard and can easily be removed with just your hands. Scoop out any of the material inside of the square opening so that the plants can rest at the bottom of the table. Then sand the edges of the square opening you created so everything looks even and smooth. To make sure that paint will stick to the table, apply two even coats of primer. We recommend Stix primer, but any good adhesive primer will do. Make sure to coat the legs of the table too! Wait until the primer has dried and then apply two coats of paint. Pro Tip: make sure you let the first coat of paint dry completely (about an hour) before you start the second to avoid the paint being pulled up by a roller. Now you’re ready to start stenciling! Start from the middle of the table and work your way outwards. This will make it easier to plan out the spacing in between each different stencil design. You can even take it a step farther and use a chalk pencil to outline specific parts of each stencil, so you remember where you wanted each stencil to go. The best part about inlay stencils is that the choice is all yours! You can mix and match different stencil patterns from the kit to suit your style and create a unique piece every time. You can also tape off certain sections of the stencil pattern to fit in certain areas or to create your own unique stencil design. This is easy and only requires a small amount of tape. Just place the tape over the sections you don’t want stenciled and the tape will act as a mask covering that part of the stencil. You can also use the T-square ruler to make sure your stencils are aligned straight! Put your stencil where desired and then place the T-square part of the ruler up against the edge of the table so that the ruler is next to the stencil. If the entire edge of the stencil touches the ruler, the stencil is straight and you can start stenciling! If not, simply readjust the stencil so that the edge matches up with the ruler and then begin stenciling. Once you’ve finished stenciling the major elements, you can always go back and add small details to fill up any empty space! Just place the stencil in the desired space and tape off the sections you don’t want to stencil. It’s that easy! Once the surface of the table is complete you can move onto the sides of the table! Work your way around until you reach the first side you started with. You can even mix and match stencil designs so that each side has a different pattern! Now you can finally stencil the legs! Flip the table on its side to make stenciling the legs even easier. If you want to stencil just a border, use a strip of blue painter’s tape to mask off the entire middle portion of the stencil. This will allow you to stencil the border in a breeze! Finish off the legs to complete the stenciling portion of this gorgeous DIY upcycled project. Seal your amazing DIY accent table with two coats of water-based polyurethane. This will help to keep your upcycled IKEA LACK table from being scratched or damaged from spills! Place a small plastic bag or some tin foil in the bottom of the square opening. This will create a barrier between the bottom of the table and the soil for the plants.

It could also be effective to cut a hole into the panel rather than cut it off, but I wanted to have enough space to change and clean litter. * I didn’t do this step but I imagine it would be helpful to reinforce the door by gluing the back panel to the shelf. 5. After that, I put all of the accessories Into the shelf. It is big enough to store his food, litter, and toys. I also placed a carpet in the bottom part to avoid the mess from the litter. Overall I only spent about $70.00. This was a good price considering the I was researching cost over $100.00. The only additional items I bought were the blanket for the cat bed as well as the carpet and mat for the cat litter. The hardest part about this hack is inserting the door. It doesn’t seem to screw into the unit that well. I would add some extra reinforcement if it seems to be coming loose. ~ by Samantha Webster", "author": "Jules Yap", "date": "2018-09-14T09:57:00-04:00", "url": "https://ikeahackers.net/2018/09/cat-corner-kallax-hack.html", "categories": ["ikea-hacks"], "tags": ["ikea", "hack", "diy"], "image_url": "https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cat-cozy-corner.png", "excerpt": "I decided to hack this item because I live in a small apartment and wanted to have a .

{"title": "The Smallest Museum in the World. Stay in the (Pappis) box, think outside!", "content": "Here’s Jacopo Carli from (see my previous ) with a fun didactic challenge: what about designing the World’s Smallest Museum in an Ikea PAPPIS Box? Not just an in scale maquette representing something bigger, but a real scale installation, a micro-show about a famous artist. So I challenged the students of my “Psychology of shapes and forms” class at the Interior and Product design . I pushed them to hack the box creating something innovative, surprising. The point is: fit in the box, think completely outside it! I think this could be a fun exercise even for other teachers or an educational game for kids and children. So, as you can’t enter into the small box the questions are: Can you open the box? Can you see inside? Can you unfold the box and use it as a surface? How can you interact with the box? Does the box beam light in the room? Are visitors passive or active in the artistic play? Here is a small selection of a few interesting and surprising work my students (interior designers, photographers, graphic designers) did for the final exam. Testa’s work in Advertisement is based on anthropomorphism and zoomorphism. Martina unfolded the Pappis box creating a “Chinese Shadow” didactic game so visitors could interact with Armando’s world, being part of the artwork. Keith Haring is the “Grand Father” of contemporary street artists. Valeria created an installation helping children to easily design Haring’s puppets so they could stick it on the blank white exterior of the box as ready-made graffiti. Loretta Lux overlays different images creating a world of surrealistic childhood. Sara designed a magic box in which you can merge different images creating your original piece of art looking through two oculars. Mark Ryden is a graphic designer and illustrator focused on contemporary surrealism. Eleonora created an installation distorting the regular perspective, creating something that could be seen by different dynamic points of view. Alessandra focused on the relationship between Monet and refractive water effects in his “Les Nimpheas” series. The installation allows users to see Monet paintings through a small water basin, understanding the effects of refraction on colours and perception. You could even customize your experience by colouring the water and putting small floating objects. Piero Manzoni was a really provocative artist famous for his “Artist’s Shit” created in 1961. Cosimo imagined an installation put across a wall so you see one side at the beginning of the visit and the other side only at the end. The closed side allows you to enter your hand but not to see inside the box, so you can win your fears and touch different mysterious and “dangerous” objects in a blind experience. At the end of the exhibition, you see the same box wide open so you could find its content “safe and clean” laughing at the scared visitors on the other side of the wall. Pink Floyd was a Rock Band well known all around the world even for their psychedelic mood. Valentina designed a Lo-Fi, DIY immersive micro space in which a built-in VR helmet and a fan create a multisensorial experience showing a short clip inspired by the band. I really love the rough outside of the box, looking as if the micro-museum travelled through a Worldwide Tour. Quentin Tarantino is famous director deeply influenced by a sort of mythology of “retrò atmospheres” from the seventies. Stefano created a prototype of a series of boxes containing specific scenes by Tarantino. As a graphic designer, Stefano invented a Low-fi 8-bit style to design characters and scenes. A LED light with a sensor emits light and casts shadows in the room. Salvador Dalì is one of the most important exponents of surrealism. Lucrezia designed a box deeply involved with Dalì’s dreamlike atmosphere, a box that couldn’t be opened, a box melting as a waxwork heated by a flame hidden inside the box. Tim Burton is really well known for his dark atmospheres. Claudia designed a box as a tribute to the crafty attitude of the first Burton’s films. As the box couldn’t be opened you can see inside through a keyhole and get surprised by a moonlight landscape. Federica designed a box as a tribute to perspective and to Anderson’s art of shooting. Camilla designed a box as an interactive installation by Yayoi Kusama. By moving the magnetic dots on the exterior of the box, the user could move the 3D printed pumpkins in the interior changing its position and creating infinite combinations. ~ by Jacopo", "author": "Jules Yap", "date": "2018-06-25T10:15:42-04:00", "url": "https://ikeahackers.net/2018/06/museum-ikea-pappis-box.html", "categories": ["ikea-hacks"], "tags": ["ikea", "hack", "diy"], "image_url": "https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/smallest-museum-ikea-pappis.png", "excerpt": "Here’s Jacopo Carli from (see my previous ) with a fun didactic challenge: what about designing the World’s Smallest Museum in an Ikea PAPPIS Box?

{"title": "Shiplap Entertainment Center: How to build from IKEA kitchen cabinets", "content": "Here’s an entertainment center I made from IKEA kitchen cabinets with doors and shiplap. We initially wanted our favorite contractor friend to build a custom media storage unit for us, but he was too busy at the time. We looked for prefab wall units at , , Wayfair, etc., but couldn’t find just what we wanted. My wife wanted the speakers hidden, and we both wanted a built-in look, so I know I would have to do some IKEA hacking. Looking through IKEAhackers, a BESTÅ unit is a favourite when it comes to . But having built two IKEA kitchens in the past, I thought maybe I could use IKEA kitchen cabinets and modify them. I bought the 15-inch deep variety, as opposed to the usual cabinets with 24″ depth typically used in kitchen storage. (Caution, some A/V receivers won’t fit in a 15-inch deep cabinet, so be sure to measure your components.) I think using the 15-inch deep cabinets makes it look more like an entertainment wall unit; nobody suspects it’s actually modified kitchen cabinets. We also used a mix of glass and solid doors. The glass doors with adjustable shelves on the upper sections of the high cabinet gave the entire media set-up a lighter look. And the glass windows blend better with the speaker cloth at the bottom panels. We were inspired by some custom wall units online that used shiplap, which we liked. We thought that adding shiplap would give it a more custom look. Initially, I planned to use smooth, white shiplap for a more formal look, but then I came across the gray “barn wood” shiplap with the somewhat “distressed” look. I thought that would be the perfect rustic feel since it was going in a lake house. Definitely glad I went with the gray; gives it a nice contrast and unique style. The first step was to build IKEA cabinetry per IKEA instructions. Then, I put them in place and added trim to sides and tops to give it that built-in look. For the sides, I bought some primed 1x4s and cut them to fit. Attached them with L-brackets. For the tops, I just cut some of the same 1x4s and nailed them in place with a finish nailer, then caulked. I painted those pieces with a coat of paint ( ) which perfectly matched the off-white of the IKEA GRIMSLÖV cabinets. The we got from Home Depot has the look of unique reclaimed wood and we knew it would create a strong focal point in the room. Installation of the shiplap was simple. It was already primed and painted so we didn’t need the additional step of prepping the board, compared to buying raw lumber. I wanted to house my speakers inside the bottom shelf on the left and right cabinet. And to place my electronic devices in the middle horizontal front. Converting the solid doors into doors with speaker fabric will allow sound to come through and also signals from the remote control to pass through to the electronics. Cutting the kitchen cabinet doors for the speaker openings was simple. I initially bought pure white speaker fabric from . But as you can see from the photos, it didn’t match well with the off-white of the IKEA GRIMSLÖV cabinets. They ended up looking gray instead. So, then I bought some off-white speaker fabric from Amazon, and they match pretty well. After putting the speakers in the cabinet, it made the fabric darken somewhat. Doubling-up on the off-white fabric did the trick visually and didn’t impact the sound quality. About $1500 for the IKEA stuff, $100 for the shiplap and $15 for the speaker fabric. The shiplap, the hidden speakers, and the built-in look. I was worried about the sound quality with the speakers in the cabinet, but the sound is great! Besides that the media unit gave us a lot more storage flexibility and display of memorabilia. Keeping everything plumb and level. When you put in the trim pieces between the unit and the wall/ceiling, you find out that your wall and ceiling are not perfectly plumb and level! Caulking solved a lot of that. But also needed to add wood shims to level things out. Be careful when cutting the doors for the speaker openings. I kind of messed up on one, but found that the paint hid the blunder pretty well. If you screw it up too badly you can always buy another door. Initially, I cut out a space in the shiplap for the TV mount, but later realized that made it too recessed to hang the TV. So, I had to reinstall the TV mount on top of the shiplap. Also, don’t just cut several shiplap boards the same length. You may find out that your tall cabinets are not perfectly plumb. Measure each board as you go. Ideally, you want to measure the height of the boards so you don’t have a really small one on top or bottom. I screwed up my measurements (not accounting for the gap in the shiplap), so it didn’t turn out perfect. But I can live with it! Very happy with it, and we’ve received lots of compliments on it.

{"title": "IKEA Hack a Full Length Dressing Mirror with Lights", "content": "I wanted a full length dressing mirror with lights and hacking one off an IKEA mirror was less expensive and time-consuming. It would also be a better finish than purchasing a raw mirror and building a frame. There is no way I would have done this without the IKEA MONGSTAD mirror and outdoor string lights. The time, safety and sheer weight of a self-built mirror that large would have made the project not feasible. This selfie mirror requires very little to no electrical and carpentry skills to finish this project. The hardest part of this hack was making sure the holes were equally spaced. All those times you thought you would never use what you learned in Math… this project will make you wish you never said that. For best results, before drilling double check your pilot hole spacing calculations from both directions to make sure they are accurate. Make sure pilot holes along left and right frames are aligned perfectly. You don’t get a second chance once you begin drilling. To reduce weight, the top and bottom of the frame are solid. The right and left sides are hollow. There is a support beam about halfway up the sides. Note when drilling. Use caution when drilling with the Forstner bit. Practice on scrap wood first. You want to minimize the amount of damage it causes to IKEA’s finish. 1. Using scrap cardboard and tape, cover the mirror for protection from scratching and paint. Push the cardboard between the mirror and frame to ensure paint does not get on mirror. 2. Find and mark middle of top, left and right frames and align/ attach . 3. Find mid-point again and mark on tape as center line guide for holes. 4. Measure equal spacing along center line and make perpendicular mark ‘X’ for where you want each light socket. Unfortunately, I did not save my measurements. I believe for 22 bulbs my spacing was approx. 7 13/16” 5. Measure spacing from opposite direction to double check your calculations. 6. Use 1/8” bit to drill pilot holes. Try not to exit back side of mirror yet (it is ok if you do). The reason for this is, unless you are experienced, it is difficult to keep your drill level so that the top pilot hole and exit hole are aligned at 90 degrees. However, the flexibility of the outdoor string lights allows for quite a bit of error here. I was pretty far off on several but the flexibility of the corded sockets made it a non-factor in the end result. 7. Using the pilot holes as a guide, use the Forstner bit to drill the holes. To limit damage to the finish do not exit the back of the frame. You will want to drill “in” from both sides. 8. Now that you can see through the inside of the frame, center your 1/8” bit and drill the pilot holes through the back. If you are experienced and feel comfortable with keeping your drill at close to 90 degrees you can do this at step 6 and save time. 9. Turn the mirror over, use the Forstner bit and drill through the back using the pilot holes as a guide. 10. You should now have aligned holes through the front and back of the frames. 11. Remove paint tape. 12. If you choose not to paint, skip to step 15. 13. Following the instructions on the liquid sander deglosser, remove the finish from the frame. 14. Following the instructions on your spray paint, apply 3 coats. 15. Starting at the bottom of the mirror insert each socket through the holes on the back of the mirror and fasten with a screw. 16. Work your way around the entire mirror. The eye-hole provided with the string lights and a screw are enough to hold the bulb securely in place (see picture). 17. For extra support, applying glue with a hot glue gun through the back of the hole would help. (I did not do this, I felt it was secure enough with the screw only) 18. Any unused sockets at the end of the strand should be plugged for safety purposes. I used an E26 E27 Light Bulb Holder to Polarized Outlet Plug Converter Adapter. 19. Attach child proofing corner guards to top two back corners of selfie mirror before leaning against wall. 20.

{"title": "But Wifey Boss, I NEED a gaming table", "content": "I love , card games, and quick board games. However, with a 2-year-old, space is at a premium. Selling this “set-up” as a storage place and part-time gaming table is a good win with the Partner. The hack took a day, give or take a few hours. It costs around $300. The 2 units were the biggest expense, so get those on sale, if you can. What I like most about this gaming table is it’s got some good space. It’s tall, so the bar stool height encourages people to move and be active. Storage is KEY. Build the 2 Kallax, put aside. Cut the base board to the size of the width of the Kallax times 2, plus double the thickness of your top table. Base board should be flush with the Kallax when assembled. Match the corners of the Kallax to the corners of the base board. Drill and screw down. Attach the base board to the top of the Kallax for ease of build. Screw on casters to the “bottom” of the base board (which will be the top while upside down right now) GET A BUDDY: Flip the build over onto the casters. Be sure they are LOCKED to avoid rolling. The Kallax is super light, but the base board should NOT be, thus the buddy system. Cut the table top to the width of the Kallax, and the desired length. I matched the length of my table top to the depth of the Kallax + width of the table top. This means that, when stored, it will slide down even with the Kallax. If you are looking for longer table top, just know the table top will not lay flush in “storage mode”, but there could be cool applications for a sticking up section. Test your build so far by sliding your table top into the open space between the Kallaxs (Kallaxi?). They should be secure, but not scraping. A little wiggle is ok. Place your table tops as desired (likely connected, but I’m not the boss of you) and mark centerlines for toggle clamps. Two on each Kallax, each side (so 4 total on each side) and one across each side of the table divide. (This holds the table top to the Kallax and then to each other) Screw on the . The hooks should be on the table tops’ sides, the clamp parts on the side of the Kallax. These NEED to be tight when secured. The table to table clamps can be any combination you want. Getting the clamps lined up and screwed on straight while avoiding the screws already involved in the Kallax system is tricky. And there you have it! A gaming table that has storage for kids toys (on the front) and your gaming books and boxes (in the back, facing the wall). Looking back, I would have loved to add a large TV in the middle of the table top (for DnD maps), but the framing would have added width to the table and not have been as compact (which I needed). I wish I knew enough of building to maybe have a way to allow more of an edge on all 4 sides, not just 2. The clamps made this impossible, but I am still looking for future builds. Also: would have loved to use swing arms to slide the table tops out from their storage space instead of having to lift them up and lock in place. But I’m not a smart man and this task was too technical for me (is that even possible?) This hack has a lot of expanded potential. This is a great jumping off point, and I’d love to see if anyone can use it to make a more simplified/ extra version. Cause I’d love to make another one with a bit extra.

It should be long enough the contain your mattress, yet short enough to slot under easily. Join the two bed rails together with the two leftover pieces of the footboard. Then, shorten the wood slats of the second bed too, so the trundle bed fits neatly beneath the top bunk. Secure the wood slats to the bed rails. Once your trundle is done, you can move on to the top bunk. You’ll need to measure how high the top bed should be from the floor, making space for the trundle and mattress to slide in. Mark the new placement and drill new screw holes for the FJELLSE hardware. Then attach the headboards, one at the bed head and the other at the end. Place the FJELLSE wood slats on the top bunk. Slot in your trundle bed and you’re done. You may want to attach to the underside of the trundle bed. ~ by Vanessa Carol was searching for quality outdoor furniture and could not find what she was looking for.

My two boys (9 and 11) share a room, one of them sleeping in the top bunk, the other on a mattress on the floor beneath. We needed more space and it also started looking pretty childish. I looked up many IKEA hacks for before I had a rough plan in mind. We set out to IKEA, looking for either storage containers or a bed to fit underneath. After looking at all the options, I decided that the most cost-effective option would be to buy a MALM twin bed with its two storage containers and slatted base and attach the KURA bed on top of it. – – Back home, my youngest assembled the MALM bed (I helped with screwing and bolting everything together). We did not attach the headboard. Next, we prepped the KURA by tightening all of its hardware that had slowly loosened over the years. Then, we lifted the bunk bed on top of the MALM bed. Next, I lined up the heads of the beds and centered the KURA over the rest of the MALM frame. I used the holes and hardware that were meant to attach the MALM headboard to attach the head of the bunk bed to the head of the MALM bed frame. Just had to measure to make sure the holes lined up. I was only able to use one of the wooden pegs, but all three bolts. I used some random wooden pieces and poster board pieces to fill the gap between the frames along the side of the beds and then 3 long tan decking screws on each side to screw the frames together. I was worried about this not being solid or safe enough, but it is way more solid than the KURA on its own. Added the MALM bed slats and storage boxes, the existing mattress and KURA bed tent and we were all set.

Let me start by wishing you all things bright and beautiful for your home and life. Before we get into the thick of 2018, let’s recap 2017. In a nutshell, in 2017 we had fewer “hardcore” hacks, if you know what I mean. Less deconstruction and turning it into something totally out of the world. More painting and makeovers, restyles and upgrades. Which I think is what the IKEA hacking movement as a whole (not just on IH) is going through at the moment. Nonetheless, it’s always good to see people putting their touch on IKEA and making it their own. That part never gets old. So without further ado, here’s my list of the top 10 IKEA hacks of 2017, in no particular order. I hope you like them too. If I missed out your favourites, let me know in the comments.

{"title": "XL chest of drawers: One BIG MALM Dresser", "content": "Our goal was to take two dressers and make them look like one, big dresser. On hindsight, it would have been better if the dressers were the same finish (the brown one had a fake wood texture) but it ended up fine.

Attach the dressers to the 4×6’s with L-brackets. (4×6’s were probably a little excessive for this, but we have some left over from another project…and free is always good!) We bought ($50 for 10 pulls) and spray painted them Copper Rose. To attach, we made a template out of butcher paper that we would put on each drawer face. Then stain, urethane topcoat and attach the wood wrap on the top and sides. We wanted the top to go the entire length, so we cut the sides short enough to go under the top.

Hack a slim and narrow, wall mounted phone and IT sideboard to house tech equipment like wifi routers and chargers. 65€ Get the OTTEBOL door and cut it into 4 pieces like shown on the graphic: Be careful with the cut edges. They tend to break after you cut it. This was the hardest part. After that, you just take the oak plank and cut 3 pieces of 20 x 36.4cm for the base, and two inner shelves. Lastly, cut the top with a little overhang (if you want to). I did it at 20 x 42cm. Cut the mesh plate to 41 x 20cm. Smooth the edges after cutting to prevent sharp edges. Now take both side panels (right & left), be sure that the nice side is facing front.  Mill two slots (5mm deep, 20,5cm high) on the inside. That’s the spot where the mesh plate will sit. For the top and bottom planks I used wooden plugs. Drill them in, add some glue and assembly them. Now add the mesh plate, because it is thin, you can slightly bend it to insert into the slots. For the two shelves, I used a small L-profile (I’m lazy), but you can also do it with wooden dowels. Fortunately, OTTEBOL comes with predrilled holes for the hinges. But because of the cutting, you have only one left on each side. But that’s no big deal. Measure the existing hole and copy it to bottom section of your new door. To cover the existing holes on the inside, I just mounted the hinges over the inner holes. For the rest of the holes, IKEA did us a favour and added some white plastic covers you can use. Because I wanted it to float, I used three brackets for the wall mount. Why three? At first I also just used two on the top, but because of the weight of the door it got a little bit wonky while using the door. So I just put a third at the bottom and the problem is gone. That’s pretty much all there is to it. Of course I did some touch ups and sanded down the edges of all shelves, as well as cut small slots at the back of each shelf (even the bottom and top) to allow for some air flow for the IT equipment. ~ by Jogi", "author": "Jules Yap", "date": "2017-08-24T10:10:06-04:00", "url": "https://ikeahackers.net/2017/08/it-sideboard-wifi-router-cabinet.html", "categories": ["ikea-hacks"], "tags": ["ikea", "hack", "diy"], "image_url": "https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IT-sideboard-charging-station.jpg", "excerpt": "Keep cable clutter at bay.

{"title": "IKEA LACK Raspberry Pi Case / Storage Table", "content": "2 x Gloss White Lack Side tables I became the owner of a late last year which was going to be used for casual retro gaming. I like my AV setup quite neat, so wanted somewhere I could keep the Pi whilst it wasn’t in use, and away from my toddler’s hands! I’d seen the LACK hacked for storage a few other times, but was inspired by an old hack I’d seen years ago whereby the LACK had a sliding top. Due to the space it was going in, I needed a hinged top to make the contents accessible. In addition to the LACK tables, I also used: Optional: I started by taking the wooden batons and drawing around them on the underside of both tables. These are to strengthen the table top as the innards were coming out. I measured an extra 10mm over on what was going to be the bottom table as I wanted a slight overhang once the batons were pushed in to place. Once marked up, I cut the square out very carefully with a sharp . It’s important to keep the edges straight as these will be on display when the table is open, but it is also important to keep the section whole as you’ll be needing this later on. Once cut out, remove all the honeycomb filling making sure that the surface is as flat as you can make it. Once removed, cut your batons to size. I squeezed some wood glue all around the innards of the table and pressed the batons in place (the wood I purchased was the exact fit for the gap — I did a trial on an old LACK a few days before so I didn’t mess this one up!). I did the same for the other table top, but as you can see from the picture, this one has the slight over-hang. Once pressed in place, I squeezed loads more wood glue into the centre and put in the piece of the table I’d cut out (this is to strengthen the table top). I left it over night with weight on it to ensure it glued properly. I did this to both parts. I then took my door hinges, measured them equally apart and again, used the to cut them out. Because the frame inside the table top is very narrow, it’s important to make sure that the batons that you put in are pressed right against the inner frame as the hinges will screw into this. I then attached the legs and one of the dampers ensuring the table top with the overhang is on the bottom. As you can see, there is a slight cutout for the damper to slot into when the top is closed. When happy, I added the second damper, and drilled/countersunk/screwed the batons in place, but on the base only as this is going to be covered. I then took the self adhesive fabric and covered the surface of the bottom table, tucking it underneath to make it look neat. I then added the Shadowfoam, by tucking it under the overhang of the bottom table (this is why the cutout on the bottom table was slightly smaller). I then added my Raspberry Pi and accessories and cut them into the Shadowfoam. Once I was happy with how it looked, I removed the top and sanded/sprayed white to match the exterior. Once dry, I reattached and put in place. And there you have it, one storage table for my Raspberry Pi, hidden away from little fingers! If attempting yourself, it is important to make sure you reinforce the table top using the part you cut out as the table top isn’t as strong as it was (in one picture you can see I used some white hardboard that I had knocking around as I accidentally chucked my cut out away!). ~ by Daniel Moore", "author": "Jules Yap", "date": "2017-09-18T10:21:41-04:00", "url": "https://ikeahackers.net/2017/09/lack-raspberry-pi-case-storage.html", "categories": ["ikea-hacks"], "tags": ["ikea", "hack", "diy"], "image_url": "https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Raspberry-Pi-box-IKEA-hack.jpg", "excerpt": "2 x Gloss White Lack Side tables I became the owner of a late last year which was going to be used for casual retro gaming.

I needed some lights for my stone path in the front yard and wanted something unique and finally concluded I needed to make my own. They needed to be solar so they would not require any exterior wiring and could be easily moved as needed. I search all over to find a suitable candidate for the outer containers. They needed a top so they would not fill with water in the rain and still allow a wire to exit so the solar cell could be positioned to catch the light. I found the Droppar Jar with Lid at IKEA to be perfect as it has a lid and a clear top which allowed me to put the solar cell inside, making them completely self-contained. I started by cutting 2″ PVC pipes into sections about 5″ long (your needs may vary based on the thickness of the solar cell on your string lights). I then cut notches into the top and bottom as shown. This does not have to be pretty as none of this will show when you are done. I then took the last light on the string and hooked it into the notch on one side of the tube as shown, twist the wire as I went to ensure the LEDs pointed straight outward as much as possible, then continued to wrap the string around the PVC tube until I ran out of bulbs. I then wrapped the extra wire through the notches on the other end until it was secure. Lastly I placed the solar cell on top. Then I simply slid the whole assembly into the Droppar and put on the lid.

{"title": "BILLY Wrap-Around", "content": "4x BILLY 80cm Shelves + 3x BILLY 40cm Shelves + Top Extension Units + 1x GERTON Beech Table Top. 6 or 7 lengths of 89mm x 39cm pine to help with construction. Bit of paint. : We needed bookcases in the spare room and chose Billy as the starting point. We also needed desks that could fold out from the shelves, so we could work in this mini-library but also save space when not in use. Fortunately the GERTON table top was 75cm wide and was chosen as a perfect fit into the 80cm BILLY bookcases (once you’d accounted for the width of the uprights). 1x GERTON was enough as I chopped it in half to create folding desks. The hinges on the GERTON desks were probably the hardest bit of the whole construction and took a lot of patience. The need to get the right widths on the left hand wall was the first step and this was also important for the desk positions. I actually liked having to use spacers between the units as the shelves gained more of a built-in look. Notice that the fixed middle shelf on a BILLY is right where you want a monitor to go, so the middle shelf had to be installed lower down at desk height. This involved quite a few angle brackets to keep it secure. I repeated the exercise on the right hand wall, then turned my attention to the upper units. The top sections were boosted higher so that we didn’t end up with an un-usable gap near the ceiling. Because they were put on stilts, the top sections needed to be upside down, and so the hardboard from the BILLY units was then used for the very top (since it didn’t need to be load-bearing). If you can only count 3x 80cm BILLYs in the picture and wonder why I bought four, that is because the fourth one was hacked up and used above the door. The whole thing was painted, electrics were added for the computers and lastly a load of clutter! ~ by Nigel", "author": "Jules Yap", "date": "2017-05-18T10:06:04-04:00", "url": "https://ikeahackers.net/2017/05/billy-wrap-around.html", "categories": ["ikea-hacks"], "tags": ["ikea", "hack", "diy"], "image_url": "https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Stage-0-before.jpg", "excerpt": "4x BILLY 80cm Shelves + 3x BILLY 40cm Shelves + Top Extension Units + 1x GERTON Beech Table Top. 6 or 7 lengths of 89mm x 39cm pine to help with construction.

{"title": "Portholes from IKEA Groggy trays", "content": "For one porthole you need two Groggy trays and one circular piece of glass or acrylic 345mm (13 ½”) diameter and 3mm thick. A glazier can cut the glass for you and he/she can also heat treat it so that it’s toughened and much safer to use. Toughened glass is much stronger and you won’t cut yourself on it if it breaks. I also used some . 1. Cut the bottom off the trays so that the thickness of what’s left of the two trays plus the glass equals the thickness of your door. For example if the glass is 3mm and the door 44mm you should leave 20mm of the tray (strictly speaking it should be 20.5mm but a 0.5mm gap is OK). I used an angle grinder with a thin blade to cut the trays but you might be able to use a hacksaw or jigsaw with a fine metal blade. Note that the tray is stainless steel so quite tough. File down the sharp edges. I fixed some along the outside/backside of the cut edge of the trays. I let it stick out a little bit so that when the two trays come together the strips get squeezed against the glass and hold the glass in place. This is especially important to prevent the glass from moving if you’ve got a hollow core door. If you’ve got a solid door you can just put a bead of silicone around the glass/steel corner afterwards to stop the glass from rattling around. 2. Cut a circular hole in the door the same size as the glass. You can use the glass as a template and cut it with a jigsaw. I used a router and a pivot hole in the centre. 3. Fix one tray from one side of the door and then fit the glass and the other tray from the other site. I just glued the trays to the door with silicone but you can also use screws or even straight through bolts for a more nautical look. We’ve had 9 of these portholes in our home for over 10 years now and they still look great. They let extra light in and let you glimpse what’s in the other room. I don’t use them on bedroom or bathroom doors but you could use frosted glass or mirror glass instead. Please note that the portholes shouldn’t be used in fire doors for safety reasons. I also wouldn’t recommend using them on an outside door unless you fix them very securely and make sure they don’t let rain water into the door. ~ by Jonas Andersson", "author": "POJonas", "date": "2017-05-16T10:28:35-04:00", "url": "https://ikeahackers.net/2017/05/portholes-ikea-groggy-trays.html", "categories": ["ikea-hacks"], "tags": ["ikea", "hack", "diy"], "image_url": "https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/porthole.jpg", "excerpt": "For one porthole you need two Groggy trays and one circular piece of glass or acrylic 345mm (13 ½”) diameter and 3mm thick.
